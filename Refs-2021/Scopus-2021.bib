abstract={Linguistic Deception Detection DD is a well-established part of forensic linguistics and an area that continues to attract attention on the part of researchers, self-styled experts, and the public at large. In this article, the various approaches to DD within the general field of linguistics are examined. The basic method is to treat language as a form of behaviour and to equate marked linguistic behaviour with other marked forms of behaviour. Such a comparison has been identified in other fields such as psychology and kinesics as being associated with stress linked to the attempt to deceive, typically in such contexts as examined here. Representative authentic examples of some of the most common linguistic indicators of deception that have been identified are discussed, dividing them into two general categories which we here introduce: language as revealer and language as concealer. We will argue that linguistic analysis for DD should be conducted relative to the subject's individual linguistic patterns of behaviour, not on absolutes related to broad generalisations about what is supposedly normal or unmarked in the population at large. We will also briefly discuss some structured methods for linguistic analysis for DD and the prospect that technology and artificial intelligence will provide the means to automate and digitalise the linguistic DD process. We maintain that caution is advisable when considering these, as DD will, in all probability, always remain a work in progress, with the need for a flexible human evaluator ready to take into account many different aspects of the individual subject and the case in question. © 2021 Thomas Wulstan Christiansen, published by Sciendo.},

abstract={Background: Deception is present in all walks of life, from social interactions to matters of homeland security. Nevertheless, reliable indicators of deceptive behavior in real-life scenarios remain elusive. Methods: By integrating electrophysiological and communicative approaches, we demonstrate a new and objective detection approach to identify participant-specific indicators of deceptive behavior in an interactive scenario of a two-person deception task. We recorded participants' facial muscle activity using novel dry screen-printed electrode arrays and applied machine-learning algorithms to identify lies based on brief facial responses. Results: With an average accuracy of 73%, we identified two groups of participants: Those who revealed their lies by activating their cheek muscles and those who activated their eyebrows. We found that the participants lied more often with time, with some switching their telltale muscle groups. Moreover, while the automated classifier, reported here, outperformed untrained human detectors, their performance was correlated, suggesting reliance on shared features. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using wearable electrode arrays in detecting human lies in a social setting and set the stage for future research on individual differences in deception expression. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Accurate recognition of micro-expressions facilitates emotional communication, and correct capture of expressions is associated with deception detection. The combination of artificial intelligence and psychology can be widely used in various fields such as national life, agricultural production, product development, and garrison construction. This study analyzes and explores whether there is a correlation between parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability, which can provide a basis for subsequent artificial intelligence to detect emotions. This paper mainly uses offline collection of micro-expression recognition data and filling out questionnaires at the same time to collect data and conduct survey research. A total of 175 questionnaires were collected, of which 175 were valid. 110 data of micro-expression recognition were collected, of which 100 were valid. The results found that there was a significant correlation between the parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability of college students. Specifically, the rejection dimension of parents was significantly and negatively correlated with micro-expression recognition ability. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of fields, among which the combination of machine learning and expression recognition can effectively improve the possibility of screening out suspicious people in specific situations. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Online news consumption has rapidly increased, and so has the proliferation of false information. People worldwide have mainly become dependent on social media networks to intake news about the happenings around them. Also, the data is profoundly contaminated with wrong information that harms society in uncountable ways. It is of huge importance to be able to identify a false message. The research society is contributing to solving the problem by developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. With misinformation spreading ubiquitously, various data modalities have emerged that become carriers of such false news. Research trend is advancing towards multi-modal fake news detection to authenticate text, images, and videos on the web. Existing studies have elaborated on the successful use of RNNs and CNNs. Being a new NLP technique, BERT has been used by a limited number of studies, while multiscale CNNs have not been explored yet to apply fake news detection. This research proposes a novel framework using BERT and multiscale CNNs to perform multi-modal fake news classification and achieve results higher than the existing state-of-the-art techniques. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The identification of faked identities, especially within the Internet environment, still remains a challenging issue both for companies and researchers. Recently, however, latency-based lie detection techniques have been developed to evaluate whether the respondent is the real owner of a certain identity. Among the paradigms applied to this purpose, the technique of asking unexpected questions has proved to be useful to differentiate liars from truth-tellers. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a choice reaction times (RT) paradigm, combined with the unexpected question technique, could efficiently detect identity liars. Results demonstrate that the most informative feature in distinguishing liars from truth-tellers is the Inverse Efficiency Score (IES, an index that combines speed and accuracy) to unexpected questions. Moreover, to focus on the predictive power of the technique, machine-learning models were trained and tested, obtaining an out-of-sample classification accuracy of 90%. Overall, these findings indicate that it is possible to detect liars declaring faked identities by asking unexpected questions and measuring RTs and errors, with an accuracy comparable to that of well-established latency-based techniques, such as mouse and keystroke dynamics recording. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has impelled the majority of schools and universities around the world to switch to remote teaching. One of the greatest challenges in online education is preserving the academic integrity of student assessments. The lack of direct supervision by instructors during final examinations poses a significant risk of academic misconduct. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detecting potential cases of cheating on the final exam using machine learning techniques. We treat the issue of identifying the potential cases of cheating as an outlier detection problem. We use students’ continuous assessment results to identify abnormal scores on the final exam. However, unlike a standard outlier detection task in machine learning, the student assessment data requires us to consider its sequential nature. We address this issue by applying recurrent neural networks together with anomaly detection algorithms. Numerical experiments on a range of datasets show that the proposed method achieves a remarkably high level of accuracy in detecting cases of cheating on the exam. We believe that the proposed method would be an effective tool for academics and administrators interested in preserving the academic integrity of course assessments. Copyright: © 2021 Kamalov et al.

abstract={The gigantic growth of platforms that give individuals the ability to write a review that is visible to everyone and the huge number of documents shared on the internet have triggered the researchers to try to detect if these platforms are trying to mislead and deceive people. There is a crucial need to find ways to automatically identify fake reviews and detect deceptive people or groups. The main aim of this research is to detect deception in open domain text by using a machine learning technique. Several sets of features are used to analyse the text including unigram, part of speech, and production rules. The experimental results showed that combined feature sets of (part of speech and production rules) using the support vector machine classifier achieve the best accuracy, and it clearly improves on the accuracy of the results reported in a previous study. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={Spoof detection is increasingly important in practical life, and its importance in assisting customs inspections, public security detection, trial, telecom fraud and other aspects is self-evident. Speech spoof detection has attracted much attention because of its advantages such as strong concealment, non-contact and relatively objective data. However, in general, speech spoofing detection is still in the development stage. With the rise of big data and machine learning, more and more researchers combine spooling detection with machine learning. Based on the lie database, they use machine learning training model to greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of spoofing detection. This paper introduces the development history of lie detection technology, the basic indicators of non-language degradation and the correlation between acoustic characteristics and lie detection, then introduces some speech lie detection databases and lie detection based on big data and machine learning, and finally gives the prospect of speech lie detection. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Emotions are one of the most prominent features on the human face that let's one study the feelings that another person experiences. It is a way to communicate in a non-verbal way, which is easy to understand, but quite challenging for automated machines. Facial emotion recognition is one of the field of artificial intelligence that has been most promptly researched. This paper demonstrates the classification of realtime human facial expressions into one of the seven categories of emotions using a simple 4-layer Convolution Neural Network(CNN) architecture. The facial features from the input images are extracted and pre-processed through a series of filters and then given to the classifier for the final output. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of the system by deploying various pre-processing and feature extraction techniques to the input images. In addition, data augmentation is done to tackle the overfitting issues. The dataset used for testing and training is FER2013 and the proposed model gives an accuracy of 73%. The FER model can be very useful for business promotions, lie detection, and in areas requiring additional security. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={There is growing interest in the use of automated psychological profiling systems, specifically applying machine learning to the field of deception detection. Several psychological studies and machine-based models have been reporting the use of eye interaction, gaze and facial movements as important clues to deception detection. However, the identification of very specific and distinctive features is still required. For the first time, we investigate the fine-grained level eyes and facial micro-movements to identify the distinctive features that provide significant clues for the automated deception detection. A real-time deception detection approach was developed utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning approaches to model the non-verbal deceptive behavior. Artificial neural networks, random forests and support vector machines were selected as base models for the data on the total of 262,000 discrete measurements with 1,26,291 and 128,735 of deceptive and truthful instances, respectively. The data set used in this study is part of an ongoing programme to collect a larger dataset on the effects of gender and ethnicity on deception detection. Some observations are made based on this data which should not be interpreted as scientific conclusions, but pointers for future work. Analysis of the above models revealed that eye movements carry relatively important clues to distinguish truthful and deceptive behaviours. The research outcomes align with the findings from forensic psychologists who also reported the eye movements as distinctive for the truthful and deceptive behavior. The research outcomes and proposed approach are beneficial for human experts and has many applications within interdisciplinary domains. © 2020},

abstract={Steganographer detection aims to identify guilty users who conceal secret information in a number of images for the purpose of covert communication in social networks. Existing steganographer detection methods focus on designing discriminative features but do not explore relationship between image features or effectively represent users based on features. In these methods, each image is recognized as an equivalent, and each user is regarded as the distribution of all images shared by the corresponding user. However, the nuances of guilty users and innocent users are difficult to recognize with this flattened method. In this paper, the steganographer detection task is formulated as a multiple-instance learning problem in which each user is considered to be a bag, and the shared images are multiple instances in the bag. Specifically, we propose a similarity accumulation graph convolutional network to represent each user as a complete weighted graph, in which each node corresponds to features extracted from an image and the weight of an edge is the similarity between each pair of images. The constructed unit in the network can take advantage of the relationships between instances so that common patterns of positive instances can be enhanced via similarity accumulations. Instead of operating on a fixed original graph, we propose a novel strategy for reconstructing and pooling graphs based on node features to iteratively operate multiple convolutions. This strategy can effectively address oversmoothing problems that render nodes indistinguishable although they share different instance-level labels. Compared with the state-of-the-art method and other representative graph-based models, the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness and reliability ability across image domains, even in the context of large-scale social media scenarios. Moreover, the experimental results also indicate that the proposed network can be generalized to other multiple-instance learning problems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the pursuit of new methods for concealed memory detection, event-related potential components (ERP) have been placed at the forefront of research. No method, however, is scientifically complete without a theory and the present study therefore aimed to unravel the cognitive processes underlying these ERPs (i.e., orienting and arousal inhibition). This was accomplished by using a Concealed Information Test (CIT) in which participants were once motivated to conceal and once motivated to reveal their identity. The results showed a similarly strong P3 CIT effect in the two motivational conditions, which was enhanced for high salience compared to low salience identity items. Similar results were observed when using a multivariate machine-learning algorithm – suggesting that brain-based concealed memory detection is driven mainly by orientation to salient stimuli, rather than by arousal inhibition. In addition, the algorithm, trained and tested on the ERPs of different identity items, achieved detection rates exceeding those achieved by the P3. This implies that CIT researchers and practitioners could potentially rely on the entire ERP waveform instead of a-priori selecting separate components. Together these results enrich current understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurophysiological responding to concealed information and pave the way for novel and powerful algorithms which could be used in real-life forensic investigations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the past decade, the rapid spread of large volumes of online information among an increasing number of social network users is observed. It is a phenomenon that has often been exploited by malicious users and entities, which forge, distribute, and reproduce fake news and propaganda. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the automatic detection of fake news on Twitter that involves (a) pairwise text input, (b) a novel deep neural network learning architecture that allows for flexible input fusion at various network layers, and (c) various input modes, like word embeddings and both linguistic and network account features. Furthermore, tweets are innova-tively separated into news headers and news text, and an extensive experimental setup performs classification tests using both. Our main results show high overall accuracy performance in fake news detection. The proposed deep learning architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art classifiers, while using fewer features and embeddings from the tweet text. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Deception detection is a prevalent problem for security practitioners. With a need for more large-scale approaches, automated methods using machine learning have gained traction. However, detection performance still implies considerable error rates. Findings from different domains suggest that hybrid human-machine integrations could offer a viable path in detection tasks. Method: We collected a corpus of truthful and deceptive answers about participants' autobiographical intentions (n = 1640) and tested whether a combination of supervised machine learning and human judgment could improve deception detection accuracy. Human judges were presented with the outcome of the automated credibility judgment of truthful or deceptive statements. They could either fully overrule it (hybrid-overrule condition) or adjust it within a given boundary (hybrid-adjust condition). Results: The data suggest that in neither of the hybrid conditions did the human judgment add a meaningful contribution. Machine learning in isolation identified truth-tellers and liars with an overall accuracy of 69%. Human involvement through hybrid-overrule decisions brought the accuracy back to chance level. The hybrid-adjust condition did not improve deception detection performance. The decision-making strategies of humans suggest that the truth bias - the tendency to assume the other is telling the truth - could explain the detrimental effect. Conclusions: The current study does not support the notion that humans can meaningfully add the deception detection performance of a machine learning system.

abstract={Deception detection has important clinical and legal implica-tions. Detecting deception is very effective in criminal investiga-tions, finding fake news, jurisprudence, law enforcement, and national security. Still, a reliable and Noninvasive deception technique is in progress. Deception detection using visual data is one of the most explored topics for burgeoning researchers. Several studies have been conducted on detecting deception using visual data. But most of them are based on courtroom trial data or mock criminal scenarios. In this paper, we have explored factual data set to identify deception from the subject's natural response to truth and lie by analyzing Facial Action Units (FAU). Firstly, we selected apex frames of a video sequence and incepted all possible feature sets. Secondly, we analyzed the result of five machine learning classifiers on selected important features for detecting deception. We observed that Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM-RBF), outperformed among all with 61.54% cross-validated accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, we present a novel approach to one of computational paralinguistic tasks - automatic detection of deceptive and truthful information in human's speech. This task belongs to the aspects of destructive behaviour and was first presented at the International INTERSPEECH Computational Paralinguistics Challenge ComParE in 2016. The need of contactless method for deception detection follows from the fact that existing contact-based approaches such as polygraphs and lie detectors have multiple restrictions, which significantly limit their usage. Both for training and testing of the proposed models we used two English-language corpora (Deceptive Speech Database and Real-Life Trial Deception Detection Dataset). We extracted tree sets of acoustic features from those audio samples using openSMILE toolkit. The proposed approach includes preprocessing of the extracted acoustic features with the usage of methods for data augmentation and dimensionality reduction of feature space. We have got 1680 speech utterances and 986-dimensional informative feature vector for each utterance. The main part of the proposed approach is two-level recognition model, where the first level includes three models of gradient boosting (Catboost, XGBoost and LightGBM). The second level consists of logistic regression-based model for final prediction on truthfulness or deceptiveness that takes into account predictions from the first level. Using this approach, we have achieved the result of classification in terms of F-score = 85.6%. The proposed approach can be used both independently and as a component of multimodal systems for detection of deceptive and truthful utterances in speech, as well as in systems for detection of a destructive behaviour. © 2021 ABBYY PRODUCTION LLC.

abstract={Lying is a common act in daily life and may have various degrees of falsehood. Deception detection has always been a fascinating area of research in which many studies have been conducted using subjects' facial, verbal or bodily cues to spot potential deceit. However, none of the studies have investigated the physiological responses of observers in response to misleading statements with various degrees of falsehood. In this paper, we investigated this problem by first conducting designed experiments to collect participants' physiological signals while they were watching stimulus videos with various falsehood levels. Then, the data was analysed using machine learning or deep learning models. Various challenges including relatively small amounts of training data and imbalanced classes have been addressed by implementing data augmentation. The results show that deep learning models, such as ResNet and VAE-LSTM, can predict the degree of falsehood with an F1-measure up to 0.83 from observers' reactions when compared to the stimuli ground truth. This was attained when the model was trained with the most useful physiological signal in this study, Electrodermal Activity (EDA). This result indicates that observers' physiological signals can be used as an indicator to determine the degree of falsehood for misleading statements. In the future, this system may be applied to provide an objective evaluation for deception detection. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In present days, Facial Expression Acknowledgment (FER) has now become an unbelievable issue in contemporary science study. Facial expression, a vital mode of communication of human emotions, has been studied throughout the world in the fields of Driver Protection, human computer interaction (HCI), deception detection, health care, monitoring etc. Generative Adverse Networks (GANs), with various gestures, can create more one-to-one faces that can be used to improve data base. Facial expression recognition is one of the most effective naturalizing and instant means for people to convey their feelings and intentions. FER is a common research subject which has brought a range of computational vision tasks, such as image generation, video generation, super resolution reconstruction and image translation. Happiness, sorrow, surprise, disgust, fear and rage all constitute six universal facial expressions. Other things such as eye change, breathing and combing the variance in expression will underline all the emotion above. A face recognition device is a behavior request for the identification or authentication of an individual automatically from a digital picture or from a video source. This analysis paper helps to explain methods, strategies and challenges in the real time FER climate, which discuss and examine problems and challenges. This paper finally concludes the latest developments and addresses the problems facing the FER process and the potential of future growth. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={There is increasing recognition of the significance of the political, social, economic, and strategic effects of artificial intelligence (AI). This raises important ethical questions regarding the programming, use, and regulation of AI. This paper argues that both the programming and application of AI are inherently (cis)gendered, sexualised and racialised. AI is, after all, programmed by humans and the issue of who trains AI, teaches it to learn, and the ethics of doing so are therefore critical to avoiding the reproduction of (cis)gendered and racist stereotypes. The paper’s empirical focus is the EU-funded project iBorderCtrl, designed to manage security risks and enhance the speed of border crossings for third country nationals via the implementation of several AI-based technologies, including facial recognition and deception detection. By drawing together literature from 1) risk and security 2) AI and ethics/migration/asylum and 3) race, gender, (in)security, and AI, this paper explores the implications of lie detection for both regular border crossings and refugee protection with a conceptual focus on the intersections of gender, sexuality, and race. We argue here that AI border technologies such as iBorderCtrl pose a significant risk of both further marginalising and discriminating against LGBT persons, persons of colour, and asylum seekers and reinforcing existing non entree practices and policies. © 2021, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

abstract={Human interaction often entails lies. Understanding when a partner is being deceitful is an important social skill, that also robots will need, to properly navigate social exchanges. In this work, we investigate how good are human observers at detecting false claims and which features they base their judgment on. Moreover, we compare their performance with that of an algorithm for lie detection developed for the robot iCub and based uniquely on pupillometry. We ran an online survey asking participants to classify as truthful or deceptive 20 videos of individuals describing complex drawings to iCub, either correctly or untruly. They also had to rate their confidence and provide a written motivation for each classification. Responders achieved an average accuracy of 53.9% with a higher score on detecting lies (55.4%) with respect to true statements (52.8%). Also, they performed better and more confidently on the videos iCub failed to classify than on the ones iCub correctly detected. Interestingly, the human observers listed a wide range of behavioral features as means to decide whether a speaker was lying, while the robot’s judgment was driven by pupil size only. This suggests that an avenue for improving lie detection could be a joint effort between humans and robots, where human sensitivity to subtle behavioral cues could complement the quantitative assessment of physiological signals feasible to the robot. Finally, based on the reported motivations, we speculate and give hints on how the lie detection field should evolve in the future, aiming to portability to real-world interactions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Robots destined to tasks like teaching or caregiving have to build a long-lasting social rapport with their human partners. This requires, from the robot side, to be capable of assessing whether the partner is trustworthy. To this aim a robot should be able to assess whether someone is lying or not, while preserving the pleasantness of the social interaction. We present an approach to promptly detect lies based on the pupil dilation, as intrinsic marker of the lie-associated cognitive load that can be applied in an ecological human–robot interaction, autonomously led by a robot. We demonstrated the validity of the approach with an experiment, in which the iCub humanoid robot engages the human partner by playing the role of a magician in a card game and detects in real-time the partner deceptive behavior. On top of that, we show how the robot can leverage on the gained knowledge about the deceptive behavior of each human partner, to better detect subsequent lies of that individual. Also, we explore whether machine learning models could improve lie detection performances for both known individuals (within-participants) over multiple interaction with the same partner, and with novel partners (between-participant). The proposed setup, interaction and models enable iCub to understand when its partners are lying, which is a fundamental skill for evaluating their trustworthiness and hence improving social human–robot interaction. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Facial gestures help to understand what is really going on in a visual way in someone's mind. A different meaning is expressed by different expressions. Facial expression recognition system plays an important role in the field of machine learning and deep learning; it helps us to understand a deeper meaning of human–machine interaction. Recognition of human expression with high accuracy is still a difficult task for computers. Facial expression recognition is categorized into four stages they are preprocessing, registration of face, feature extraction of face, and classification of expressions. It is used in several applications such as understanding mental disorders, analyzing what is going on in a human’s mind, lie detection, etc. Here, a convolutional neural network is utilized which is very effective for image processing. The data used is supervised data. The FER2013 dataset is used for analysis and popular deep learning frameworks such as Keras and OpenCV for the detection of facial expressions in an accurate manner. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Automatic deception detection is a crucial task that has many applications both in direct physical and in computer-mediated human communication. Our focus is on automatic deception detection in text across cultures. In this context, we view culture through the prism of the individualism/collectivism dimension, and we approximate culture by using country as a proxy. Having as a starting point recent conclusions drawn from the social psychology discipline, we explore if differences in the usage of specific linguistic features of deception across cultures can be confirmed and attributed to cultural norms in respect to the individualism/collectivism divide. In addition, we investigate if a universal feature set for cross-cultural text deception detection tasks exists. We evaluate the predictive power of different feature sets and approaches. We create culture/language-aware classifiers by experimenting with a wide range of n-gram features from several levels of linguistic analysis, namely phonology, morphology and syntax, other linguistic cues like word and phoneme counts, pronouns use, etc., and token embeddings. We conducted our experiments over eleven data sets from five languages (English, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, and Romanian), from six countries (United States of America, Belgium, India, Russia, Mexico, and Romania), and we applied two classification methods, namely logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT models. The results showed that the undertaken task is fairly complex and demanding. Furthermore, there are indications that some linguistic cues of deception have cultural origins and are consistent in the context of diverse domains and data set settings for the same language. This is more evident for the usage of pronouns and the expression of sentiment in deceptive language. The results of this work show that the automatic deception detection across cultures and languages cannot be handled in unified manners and that such approaches should be augmented with knowledge about cultural differences and the domains of interest. © The Author(s), 2021.

abstract={Nowadays, automatic deception detection has received considerable attention in the machine learning community owing to this research interest to its vast applications in the fields of social media, interviews, law enforcement, and the military. In this study, a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) named LieNet is proposed to precisely detect the multi-scale variations of deception automatically. Our approach is a combination of contact and non-contact-based approaches. First, 20 frames from each video are fetched and concatenated to form a single image. Moreover, an audio signal is extracted from video and treated as image input by plotting the signal into two dimensional (2D) plane. Furthermore, 13 channels of EEG signals are plotted into 2D plane and concatenated to generate an image. Second, the LieNet model extracts features from each modality separately. Third, scores are estimated using a softmax classifier for all the modalities. Finally, three scores are combined using score level fusion to obtain a score, which gives support in favor of either deception or truth. The LieNet is validated on the &#x201C;Bag-of-Lies (BoL)&#x201D;&#x201C;, Real-life (RL) trail&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Miami University Deception Detection (MU3D)" databases by considering four evaluation indexes viz., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental outcomes depict that the LieNet defeats an initial work on Set-A and Set-B of the BoL database with average accuracies of 95.91% and 96.04% respectively. The accuracies obtained by the LieNet are 97% and 98% on RL trail and MU3D databases respectively. IEEE},

abstract={In this research, four unique nonlinear speech features are extracted and analyzed to study the dissimilarity pattern between when the speaker is being deceitful and truthful based on how human speech is perceived. The speaker was under stress in a police interrogation where two ground truth and two deceitful responses were recorded during three different times of the day. Using the audio recordings from all three sessions, the cepstral features and spectral energy features are extracted. Cepstral features are the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient, from where the delta cepstrum and the time-difference cepstrum features are developed. On the other hand, the spectral energy features are the energy of Bark band energy from where the delta energy and the time-difference energy features are developed. The Levenberg-Marquardt classification method and the long short-term memory classification method are then applied to evaluate the accuracy of detecting deception based on the nine unique training and testing combinations of the three different sessions and their extracted cepstrum and spectral energy features. In addition, the principal component analysis is applied to reduce the dimensionality from the extracted features for further improvement. The projected principal components of the four types of features showed improved accuracy in order to distinguish between truthful and deceptive speech pattern. After incorporating with principal component analysis, the long short-term memory classification method with time-difference spectral energy feature shows the highest recognition rate compared to Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with other cepstral and spectral features. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social media following its introduction has witnessed a lot of scholarly attention in recent years due to its growing popularity. These various social media sites have become the mecca of information because of their less costly and easy accessibility. Although these sites were developed to enhance our lives, they are seen as both angelic and vicious. Growing misinformation and fake content by malicious users have not only plagued our online social media ecosystem into chaos, but it also meted untold suffering to humankind. Recently, social media has witnessed a reverberation amid the proliferation of fake news which has made people reluctant to engage in genuine news sharing for fear that such information is false. Consequently, there is a dire need for these fake content to be detected and removed from social media. This study explores the various methods of combating fake news on social media such as Natural Language Processing, Hybrid model. We surmised that detecting fake news is a challenging and complex issue, however, it remains a workable task. Revelation in this study holds that the application of hybrid-machine learning techniques and the collective effort of humans could stand a higher chance of fighting misinformation on social media. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Adaptive Psychological Profiling systems use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze a person’s non-verbal behavior in order to determine a specific mental state such as deception. One such system known as, Silent Talker, combines image processing and artificial neural networks to classify multiple non-verbal signals mainly from the face during a verbal exchange i.e. interview, to produce an accurate and comprehensive time-based profile of a subject’s psychological state. Artificial neural networks are typically black-box algorithms; hence, it is difficult to understand how the classification of a person’s behaviour is obtained. The new European Data Protection Legislation (GDPR), states that individuals who are automatically profiled, have the right to an explanation of how the “machine” reached its decision and receive meaningful information on the logic involved in how that decision was reached. This is practically difficult from a technical perspective, whereas from a legal point of view, it remains unclear whether this is sufficient to safeguard the data subject’s rights. This chapter is an extended version of a previous published paper in IJCCI 2019 [35] which examines the new European Data Protection Legislation and how it impacts on an application of psychological profiling within an Automated Deception Detection System (ADDS) which is one component of a smart border control system known as iBorderCtrl. ADDS detects deception through an avatar border guard interview, during a participants’ pre-registration, to demonstrate the challenges faced in trying to obtain explainable decisions from models derived through computational intelligence techniques. The chapter concludes by examining the future of explainable decision making through proposing a new Hierarchy of Explainability and Empowerment that allows information and decision-making complexity to be explained at different levels depending on a person’s abilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Although written deception is not a new invention, the emergence and progress of electronic media—and more recently social media—has changed the speed and extent of access to information in a good way, but at the same time facilitating the proliferation of disinformation as well. Automatic veracity determination, therefore, became a widely studied problem in the last years. We claim that without using a knowledge base and fact-checking, that is based solely on textual content features one cannot truly fight this phenomenon, nevertheless, such a deception detection system can be used beneficially in certain situations. In the present study we apply text categorization methods to detect fake news without involving any external knowledge base (e.g. lexicons, unlabeled corpora, pre-trained word vectors, etc.). We employ traditional bag-of-words and more recent end-to-end neural network models, and evaluate them on eight—five smaller and three larger—fake news datasets. The experimental results show that one can attain considerably precise detection performance, in some cases even in the very close vicinity of the perfect F1 score, using solely the labeled data. We also strive to explain why some of these approaches imply a better performance than others. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of social media, people has changed the way they access news. News online has become the major source of information for people. However, much information appearing on the Internet is dubious and even intended to mislead. Some fake news are so similar to the real ones that it is difficult for human to identify them. Therefore, automated fake news detection tools like machine learning and deep learning models have become an essential requirement. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five machine learning models and three deep learning models on two fake and real news datasets of different size with hold out cross validation. We also used term frequency, term frequency-inverse document frequency and embedding techniques to obtain text representation for machine learning and deep learning models respectively. To evaluate models' performance, we used accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as the evaluation metrics and a corrected version of McNemar's test to determine if models' performance is significantly different. Then, we proposed our novel stacking model which achieved testing accuracy of 99.94% and 96.05 % respectively on the ISOT dataset and KDnugget dataset. Furthermore, the performance of our proposed method is high as compared to baseline methods. Thus, we highly recommend it for fake news detection. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Human speech communication conveys semantic information of the underlying emotions corresponding to the speech of the interlocutor. So, detection of emotions by analysis of speech is important for identifying a subject’s emotional state. Numerous features from human speech are used by convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques to detect the emotions such as anger, happiness, fear, sadness, surprise and neutral that are associated with the speech. Prolonged sadness is considered the prerequisite for depression. Monitoring subject’s speech over a period of time helps in detecting clinical depression. Databases of different accents of English language are taken to make sure the system incorporates multiple accents. Emotion and depression detection have applications in fields like lie detection, military, counseling, database access systems, etc. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Information manipulation and cognitive load imposition make the production of deceptive narratives difficult. But little is known about the production of deception, and how its mechanisms may help distinguish truthful from deceitful narratives. This study focuses on the measurement of keystroke dynamics while typing truthful and deceptive eyewitness testimonies after a baseline assessment. While typing their narrative, some participants would undergo an auditory cognitive load. Results show that liars typed their story slower, and in less time than the truthful participants when compared to their respective baselines. The imposition of the auditory cognitive load showed adverse results, enhancing the amount of keystrokes and the time necessary to type the narrative. Classification shows better results for deceptive narrative when no auditory cognitive load is imposed. These results are discussed in terms of expanding current models to include the cognition of linguistic production and writing strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},
