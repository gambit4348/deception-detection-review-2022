abstract={Algorithms for automatic lie detection from analysis of brain signals have remained a question of interest that fascinate the research community. Nevertheless, the detection algorithms still lack robustness while processing brain signals. The aim would be to learn whether a person is deceitful or not by detection techniques and suggest a vigorous lie detection algorithm. Moreover, recently proposed algorithms for lie detection have shown to achieve a classification accuracy of around 96%. While different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, multilayer neural network, Extreme Learning Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis have proposed which typically utilizes three different types of features like time domain features, frequency domain features, and wavelet features, are anticipated in the literature. Accordingly, in this research paper, we presented a lie detection system from the P300 wave. For automatic optimum feature learning, we applied an approach from deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is very effective for classification problems. The presented model significantly achieves high accuracy of 99.6%. The experimental outcomes show that the technique put forward achieves the maximum accuracy with a lesser amount of training and testing time and reveal improved performance. Additionally, an all-inclusive discussion on the choice of appropriate CNN architecture and classification results presented in this paper along with a comparison with the prior approaches of lie detection.},

abstract={Deception Detection System (PREDICTOR) is a solution to support the criminal investigation process by providing a technological analysis in justifying the guilt of an accused criminal in the investigation process. This study gives guidelines to substantiate decision making in the interrogation. In judicature, the importance of a platform that is capable of analyzing the genuineness and the (a) reliability of a lie and a truth, (b) emotion of the suspect and the (c) attentiveness has been recognized for a long period. The feasibility of using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build such platforms has been explored before. However, no known platform could identify the suspect's authenticity, emotion, and attentiveness. The goal is to analyze the brain waves and build a real-time deception detection application to analyze lie/truth, emotion and the attentiveness, which will support the investigation process in a wide range of angles to decision making. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based real-time lie detection, emotion detection, and attention detection will be implemented using ML tools and techniques along with the help of special hardware equipment called MUSE 2 headband. Especially this equipment is required for the data acquisition as well as the creation of the final application. The outcome of this system is a solution to be used during the criminal investigation process as a deception detection system for lie, emotion and attentiveness of the suspect. This is more effective in the questioning process to get an idea of the suspect. This system will have a major impact on the Police Department, Criminal Investigation Department, and Judicial System to ensure the real criminal and reduce the workload of Criminal Investigation officers.},

abstract={Eye Blink Pattern can be used for the identification of various human behaviors. This paper proposes a method for lie detection and detecting the truth of an alibi through image processing techniques. The lie detection mechanism is based upon the experimentally proven hypothesis derived from eye blink literature that liars experience more cognitive demand than truth tellers. Thus, their lies are associated with a significant decrease in eye blinks, directly followed by an increase in eye blinks when the cognitive demand ceases, after the lie has been told. Blink detection is done with the help of MATLAB using the HAAR Cascade algorithm. The decision regarding the open or closed state of the eyes is made by implementing skin detection algorithm on the histogram back projections of the detected eye images.},

abstract={A large number of stimuli were often used for identify the guilty subjects in lie detection. In this paper, we proposed a novel lie detection approach to enhance the identification accuracy of the subjects. The independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate the EEG signals, and a reconstruction algorithm was presented to recognize the P300 components automatically, and then reconstruct the P300 in the Pz electrode. We extracted two groups of features based on time-, frequency-domains from the reconstructed Pz signals. SVM was employed to classify the two kinds of feature vectors. The balance test accuracy of 82.45% suggests that the presented method could effectively detect the deceptive and truthful responses. In addition, the related result shows that identifying the subjects in lie detection could be implemented based on small-number P300 responses using the proposed method.},

The potential was analyzed using a non-invasive technique that detects the head movement out of video. In the literature there is a lot of information regarding lie indicators and for this reason we made a short review of them. Application was built in order to detect the head movement and head position by performing a frame-to-frame analysis on a color video stream. Tests were performed on a group of ten volunteers and the results confirmed the theory. A correlation was made between head movement/ position and lie detection. Although the results confirmed the theory they are not concluding because this information cannot be used without other additional information from the other information channels like voice, words, gaze and so on. User must correlate the responses of the suspects with the response of the application in order to decide what the verdict is.},

abstract={Automatic deception detection from the video has gained a paramount of interest because of their applicability in various real-life applications. The recorded videos contain various information such as temporal variations of the face, linguistics and acoustics, which can be used together, to detect deception automatically. In this work, we proposed a new approach based on multimodal information like audio, linguistic (or text) and non-verbal features. The proposed multimodal deception detection framework is based on combining the decision from the audio, text and non-verbal features using majority voting. The proposed multimodal deception system is banked on the audio system based on Cepstral Coefficients (CC) and Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) of fixed length audio sequences. The text system is based on bag-of-n-grams features and the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier while the non-verbal features are classified using the AdaBoost classifier. Extensive experiments are carried out on a publicly available real-life deception video dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. The obtained results on a 25-cross-fold validation have indicated a deception detection accuracy of 97% out-performing both state-of-the-art techniques and human performance on the whole dataset.},

Back-propagation network and support vector machine classifiers were also used to compare with the proposed method.

In this study, the LD experiment based on the standard three stimuli protocol was designed to gather information of the twenty subjects' EEG. Phase Locking Value (PLV) was used as a statistical measure from PS for the aim of few stimulus in LD experiment. Experimental result shows first a specific spatial and temporal disparity in PS that guilty group has a stronger /higher PLV than innocent group. In particular, the result of pattern recognition---high accuracy is up to 88%. It is concluded that functional connectivity network for lie detection can help to collect more insight into the deception process. Therefore, PLV can be considered to be a valid method to identify deception and guide us to understand cognition processing with connectivity network of lie.},

abstract={Deception is pervasive, often leading to adverse consequences for individuals, organizations, and society. Information systems researchers are developing tools and evaluating sensors that can be used to augment human deception judgments. One sensor exhibiting particular promise is the eye tracker. Prior work evaluating eye trackers for deception detection has focused on the detection and interpretation of brief eye behavior variations in response to stimuli (e.g, images) or interview questions. However, research is needed to understand how eye behaviors evolve over the course of an interaction with a deception detection system. Using latent growth curve modeling, we test how pupil diameter evolves over one's interaction with a deception detection system. The results indicate that pupil diameter changes over the course of a deception detection interaction, and that these trends are indicative of deception during the interaction, regardless if incriminating target items are shown.},

abstract={Deception detection has been a hot research topic in many areas such as jurisprudence, law enforcement, business, and computer vision. However, there are still many problems that are worth more investigation. One of the major challenges is the data scarcity problem. So far, only one multi-modal benchmark dataset on deception detection has been published, which contains 121 video clips for deception detection (61 for deceptive class and 60 for truthful class). Therefore, most of the generated deception detection models (especially deep neural network-based methods) suffered from the overfitting problem and the bad generalization ability. To solve these problems, we proposed a novel Emotion Transformation Feature (ETF) to analyze deception detection with limited data. The critical analysis and comparison of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art multi-modal methods have shown significant performance improvement up to 87.59%.},

abstract={This paper highlights our simultaneous analysis of two-dimensional far-infrared data around the two periorbital and the nostril areas for nonintrusively evaluating the deception level of the subject. In our proposed approach, measured changes in maximum skin temperatures around two periorbital regions are converted to the change in the relative blood flow velocity. A signature of the respiration pattern is also simultaneously determined in terms of the ratio of the measured maximum and minimum temperatures in the nostril area. Our simultaneous analysis of these two far-infrared signatures is similar to the standard polygraph test in that more than one of our involuntary reflexes is examined at once. Our two-year field test study covers 18 examination tests on subjects who are suspected in involving in real crime cases in Thailand. Based on our automatic baseline classification and scoring criteria, we obtain a promising classification rate of 88.9%, which is about 10% improvement compared to our analysis using far-infrared data from either the periorbital or nostril area alone.},

abstract={In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that multimodal features as well as demographic information can play an important role in increasing the performance of automatic lie detection. We introduce a large, multimodal deception detection dataset balanced across genders, and we analyze the patterns associated with the thermal, linguistic, and visual responses of liars and truth-tellers. We show that our multimodal noncontact deception detection approach can lead to a performance in the range of 60%-80%, with different modalities, different genders, and different domain settings playing a role in the accuracy of the system.},

abstract={Hearings of witnesses and defendants play a crucial role when reaching court trial decisions. Given the high-stakes nature of trial outcomes, developing computational models that assist the decision-making process is an important research venue. In this paper, we address the identification of deception in real-life trial data. We use a dataset consisting of videos collected from public court trials. We explore the use of verbal and non-verbal modalities to build a multimodal deception detection system that aims to discriminate between truthful and deceptive statements provided by defendants and witnesses. In particular, three complementary modalities (visual, acoustic and linguistic) are evaluated for the classification of deception at the subject level. The final classifier is obtained by combining the three modalities via score-level classification, achieving 83.05% accuracy in subject-level deceit detection. To place our results in perspective, we present a human deception detection study where we evaluate the human capability of detecting deception using different modalities and compare the results to the developed system. The results show that our system outperforms the average non-expert human capability of identifying deceit.},

The system is built on a configuration of artificial neural networks, which are used to detect facial objects and extract non-verbal behaviour in the form of micro gestures over short periods of time. A set of empirical experiments was conducted based a typical airport security scenario of packing a suitcase. Data was collected through 30 participants participating in either a truthful or deceptive scenarios being interviewed by a machine based border guard Avatar. Promising results were achieved using raw unprocessed data on un-optimized classifier neural networks. These indicate that a machine based interviewing technique can elicit non-verbal interviewee behavior, which allows an automatic system to detect deception.},

abstract={Deception (the action of deliberately cause someone to believe something that is not true) can have many different repercussions in daily life. However, deception detection is an inherently complex task for humans. Due to this, not only there is uncertainty on which features should be used as cues for automatic deception detection, but labeled data is scarce. In this paper, we explore typical features that can be extracted from videos for affective computing and study their performance for deception detection in videos. Additionally, we perform a study of different multimodal fusion methods meant to improve the results obtained by using the different sets of extracted features separately, including a novel set of methods based on boosting. For this study, high level features are extracted with open automatic tools for the visual, acoustical and textual modalities, respectively. Experiments are conducted using a real-life trial dataset for deception detection, as well as a novel Mexican deception detection dataset using Spanish as the spoken language.},

abstract={There are various real-world applications such as video ads, airport screenings, courtroom trials, and job interviews where deception detection can play a crucial role. Hence, there are immense demands on deception detection in videos. However, videos are inherently complex; moreover, they lack detective labels in many real-world applications, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional deception detection methods. In this paper, we study the problem of deception detection in videos. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture rich information into a coherent model and propose an end-to-end framework DEV to detect DEceptive Videos automatically, which is robust to the small number of training data. Experimental results on real-world videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and further experiments are conducted to understand important factors of deception detection in videos.},

abstract={Recently, automatic deception detection has gained momentum thanks to advances in computer vision, computational linguistics and machine learning research fields. The majority of the work in this area focused on written deception and analysis of verbal features. However, according to psychology, people display various nonverbal behavioral cues, in addition to verbal ones, while lying. Therefore, it is important to utilize additional modalities such as video and audio to detect deception accurately. When multi-modal data was used for deception detection, previous studies concatenated all verbal and nonverbal features into a single vector. This concatenation might not be meaningful, because different feature groups can have different statistical properties, leading to lower classification accuracy. Following this intuition, we apply, for the first time in deception detection, a multi-view learning (MVL) approach, where each view corresponds to a feature group. This results in improved classification results over the state of the art methods. Additionally, we show that the optimized parameters of the MVL algorithm can give insights into the contribution of each feature group to the final results, thus revealing the importance of each feature and eliminating the need of performing feature selection as well. Finally, we focus on analyzing face-based low level, not hand crafted features, which are extracted using various pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), showing that face is the most important nonverbal cue for the detection of deception.},

abstract={Deception detection plays an important role in safely and reliably using multientity advisory models such as multiagent intelligence systems. The benevolence assumption people have based their implementations of multiagent (human and/or synthetic) systems on is rarely valid in the real world. Unfortunately, deception detection is extremely challenging. The average detection rate by humans alone is only above chance, and the skill for detection has been shown to be difficult to improve even with training. In psychological studies, deception detection is typically based on examining a person's nonverbal cues and expressions such as facial expressions, gestures, and movements. In this paper, our approach instead is focused on the agent's reasoning process. We detect deception by observing the correlations between agents, which can be used to make a reasonable prediction of the agents' reasoning processes. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and show the impact of different factors on detection rate. We further conduct some preliminary experiments to explore its performance at detecting both disinformation and misinformation and that of identifying more than one deceiver in the system.},

abstract={Identity Deception Detection is a problem on social media platforms today. Not only is there challenges towards determining the authenticity of people, but also with analyzing the data that forms part of the communications. These data are of heterogeneous type and include photos, videos and sound. Furthermore, most social media platforms are operating in an uncontrolled environment. Any person can contribute content and take part. Even though age restrictions do exist there are no enforcement of these laws and honesty of the public is expected. This is dangerous for minors specifically as they are either unaware of the dangers or not mature enough to be responsible for their actions online. Online predators are aware of this fact and targeting this group specifically. This paper presents work-in-progress towards developing an intelligent Identity Deception Indicator (IDI). It is envisaged that this work could eventually assists authorities in doing large-scale observation on publicly available social media platforms, such as Twitter. Of particular interest are those personas whose behavior and online content does not fit with the age group they are conversing with.},

abstract={To detect network fraud, a three-stimulus paradigm was used in a mock crime P300-based concealed information test. A P300-based deception detection method based on a modified genetic algorithm and a confidence-coefficient-based combined classifier was created for mock network fraud detection. After the multi-domain integrated signal preprocessing and feature extraction, a modified logistic equation based multi-population genetic algorithm was adopted for feature selection to obtain an optimal feature subset. Then the confidence coefficient was proposed to determine the classification difficulty levels of samples. A combined classifier based on confidence coefficient was proposed for classification. Compared with the component classifiers and other individual classifiers, the combined classifier requires 34% less computing time and the mean classification accuracy rate is 0.2 to 2.23 percentage points higher for twelve subjects using leave-one-out cross validation. Experiment results confirm that the proposed method is effective to detect deception during network fraud simulation.},

abstract={Deception is an intended action of a deceiver to make an interrogator believe something is true (or false) that the deceiver believes to be false (or true) as a purposeful mechanism to share a mix of truthful and deceptive experiences when being asked to respond to questions. Conventionally, automatic deception detection from speech is regarded as a recognition task modeled only using the deceiver's acoustic cues and does not include temporal conversation dynamics between the interlocutors, i.e., ignoring the potential deception-related cues when the two interlocutors coordinate such a back-an-forth interaction. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework to detect deception by simultaneously considering variations and patterns of the conversation using both interlocutor's acoustic features and their conversational temporal dynamics. Our proposed model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 74.71% on a recently collected Chinese deceptive corpus of dialog games. Further analyses reveal that the interrogator behaviors are correlated to the deceivers deception behaviors, and including the conversational features provides enhanced deception detection power.},

abstract={The use of EEG signals taken from human brain showcases promising information for detecting lies and false intent in a person with increased accuracy. The physical changes detected by and EEG device are concomitant to human reaction and cannot be controlled by a person. Blinking is one such component that changes when a person lies. Blink rate cannot be simply calculated by physical observation. There are certain other methods to detect blink rate, making use of ocular tracking devices however, this method of using EEG signals to extract ocular characteristics allows this methodology to be combined with other techniques to detect lies using EEG signals. This means that a single EEG acquisition device can be used as a comprehensive lie detector. A person's blink rate decreases drastically while they are lying and then increases rapidly moments after. This can be used to check if a response to a question is true or false. For the purpose of this study we have collected data from 10 subjects, taking 10 readings from each. We have studied the number of blinks and thus the blinks per minute of a subject during and after they have told a lie. The results were then used to check if the accuracy of our method. The outcomes of the study showed a decrease in blink rate during a lie with 95.12% accuracy. This proves that blink characteristics extracted from EEG datasets can be used as an effective means to detect lies in a subject. This method provides an alternative to the existing polygraph tests used in lie detection which can conceivably be made admissible in court in the future.},

year={2012},

pages={33-38},
abstract={Detecting lies is crucial in many areas, such as airport security, police investigations, counter-terrorism, etc. One technique to detect lies is through the identification of facial micro-expressions, which are brief, involuntary expressions shown on the face of humans when they are trying to conceal or repress emotions. Manual measurement of micro-expressions is hard labor, time consuming, and inaccurate. This paper presents the Design and Development of a Lie Detection System using Facial Micro-Expressions. It is an automated vision system designed and implemented using LabVIEW. An Embedded Vision System (EVS) is used to capture the subject's interview. Then, a LabVIEW program converts the video into series of frames and processes the frames, each at a time, in four consecutive stages. The first two stages deal with color conversion and filtering. The third stage applies geometric-based dynamic templates on each frame to specify key features of the facial structure. The fourth stage extracts the needed measurements in order to detect facial micro-expressions to determine whether the subject is lying or not. Testing results show that this system can be used for interpreting eight facial expressions: happiness, sadness, joy, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and contempt, and detecting facial micro-expressions. It extracts accurate output that can be employed in other fields of studies such as psychological assessment. The results indicate high precision that allows future development of applications that respond to spontaneous facial expressions in real time.},

Such implementations further highlight the challenges of applying computationally intensive methods in online environments that involve large datasets and high speeds of data. This paper attempts to classify detection methods based on the approaches and identifies factors that, in real-time systems, will impact the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods.

abstract={Despite the widespread use of multi-physiological parameters for deception detection, they have been severely restricted due to the high degree of cooperation in contacting-detection. Therefore, a noncontacting method is proposed for deception detection using acoustic features as an input and convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) as a classifier. The algorithm extracts frame-level acoustic features whose dimension dynamically varies with the length of speech, in order to preserve the temporal information in the original speech. Bidirectional LSTM was applied to match temporal features with variable dimension in order to learn the context dependences in speech. Furthermore, the convolution operation replaces multiplication in the traditional LSTM, which is used to excavate time-frequency mixed data. The average accuracy of the experiment on Columbia-SRI-Colorado corpus reaches 70.3%, which is better than the previous works with non-contacting modes.},

abstract={Deception detection is becoming indispensable to a growing number of applications in law enforcement and other government agencies. Recently, many researchers from both speech signal area and machine learning area have already shown that automatically deception detection from speech is promising. While there are a large amount of research works on English deception detection, few efforts have been put on Chinese which is quite different due to the culture divergence. In order to show the full potential of automatically deception detection, in this paper, we first construct the deceptive and non-deceptive Chinese speech corpus which has not been published so far. And then we propose a novel machine learning-based approach to detect deception in the same gender. Several popular machine learning algorithms are applied. Moreover, a transfer learning-based algorithm is applied for cross-gender deception detection. Experimental results show that our approach performs well on real-world corpus. In intra-gender deception detection, our approach can achieve roughly the same accuracy as the traditional method on English corpus. This means our corpus is reasonable and can be used for deception detection research. In cross-gender deception detection, our approach also outperforms the baseline methods.},

abstract={Polygraph based detection systems have been used for performing guilty knowledge test (GKT) over a long period of time. More recently the advances in medical imaging techniques have resulted in a better understanding of brain activity. These techniques (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging) have allowed researchers to generate applications that are based on the enhanced understanding of brain function. Detection of concealed information using brain activity is explored in this study as a better alternative to a Polygraph. Electroencephalography (EEG) allows decoding brain signals with a higher temporal resolution by applying smart signal processing techniques. In this work a commercial off the shelf wearable EEG headset is used to record brain signals in an information concealment testing environment. Although the use of such setup restricts the number of EEG channels available to the detection algorithm, but it provides portability and ease of use when compared to clinical EEG setup. The proposed algorithm is designed to give optimum results in terms of accuracy and computation time with emphasis on an easily deployable system.},

abstract={Process management includes project management, information flow management and information management. For effective process management in concurrent engineering it is necessary to have continuous information shared among the human resources carrying out the interactive activities from different disciplines, often distributed in different geographical locations. Information on the status of the activity, status of the production development, goals, resources and constraints are very critical to plan and control the concurrent engineering project. Deceptive information would result in non-availability of correct and complete information at right time leading to inefficient process management, increased project cost and delivery delays. This paper is concerned with studying the deception detection techniques, analyzing the deceptive information in concurrent engineering and identifying the concepts to represent the deception.},

abstract={Non-verbal human social signals have emerged as an important area of study including the analysis of human deception. The ability to credibly detect truth and deception can be critical today especially due to the wave of terrorism acts and illegal immigration upheavals just to mention a few instances where individuals might not be forthright with their information. Unlike for non-verbal human social signals, with other regular data many networked groups are collaboratively sharing data in order to achieve broader and more comprehensive results. To overcome the inherent danger of data exposure in groups with potential semi-honest participants, measures have been introduced to ensure privacy, integrity, and security in such collaborative exchanges. We do notice, however, that sharing of non-verbal human social signals data is lagging behind in such sharing. As this form of data is growing rapidly and prominently, we propose a protocol that extends group sharing of such data featuring human deception detection social signals among collaborative partners. The protocol will provide privacy, integrity, and security of the data during these exchanges.},

abstract={Even though people deal with deceptions throughout their whole lives, deception detection remains a challenging problem. The average detection rate for humans is only around chance, and detection skill is unlikely to be improved through training. Therefore, researchers have studied the features of deceptive behaviors that were largely ignored in human detection. For example, physiologists look at the physiological signals such as breathing rate and blood pressure, psychologists focus on non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and gestures, and computer scientists search for linguistic cues such as length of sentences. Although they all provide promising results, they seem to neglect a critical part in a person's communication: the reasoning behind the communicated content. In this paper, a method is proposed to detect deception by identifying inconsistencies, explaining the reasoning behind the inconsistencies, and measuring the likelihood of deception based on cues in reasoning. The initial experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in identifying and explaining communications containing inconsistencies. Reasoning cues that can best discriminate deception from truth are proposed, and aspects of the verification and measurement of such cues as possible future directions of work are discussed.},

abstract={Most work on automated deception detection (ADD) in video has two restrictions: (i) it focuses on a video of one person, and (ii) it focuses on a single act of deception in a one or two minute video. In this paper, we propose a new ADD framework which captures long term deception in a group setting. We study deception in the well-known Resistance game (like Mafia and Werewolf) which consists of 5-8 players of whom 2-3 are spies. Spies are deceptive throughout the game (typically 30-65 minutes) to keep their identity hidden. We develop an ensemble predictive model to identify spies in Resistance videos. We show that features from low-level and high-level video analysis are insufficient, but when combined with a new class of features that we call LiarRank, produce the best results. We achieve AUCs of over 0.70 in a fully automated setting.},

abstract={Thermal imaging technology can be used to detect stress levels in humans based on the radiated heat from their face. In this paper, we use thermal imaging to monitor the periorbital region's thermal variations and test whether it can offer a discriminative signature for detecting deception. We start by presenting an overview on automated deception detection and propose a novel methodology, which we validate experimentally on 492 thermal responses (249 lies and 243 truths) extracted from 25 participants. The novelty of this paper lies in scoring a larger number of questions per subject, emphasizing a within-person approach for learning from data, proposing a framework for validating the decision making process, and correct evaluation of the generalization performance. A $k$ -nearest neighbor classifier was used to classify the thermal responses using different strategies for data representation. We report an 87% ability to predict the lie/truth responses based on a within-person methodology and fivefold cross validation. Our results also show that the between-person approach for modeling deception does not generalize very well across the training data.},

abstract={Although event related potentials (ERPs) have been used for the deception detection, deception-related changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) remain to be established. The purpose of this research is to test the effect of theta oscillation in information concealing. EEG is recorded when healthy volunteers performed a deceptive task in a card-like version of the Concealed Information Test (CIT) paradigm. Data were analyzed by using event-related synchronization. A significant effect in theta power was recorded. The probe stimulus elicited larger theta synchronization than the irrelevant stimulus in the 200-500 ms post-stimulus data for deceptive participants. This effect was not observed in the control group. The theta synchronization effect overlapped with the classical ERP P300 effect but with marked difference in electrodes. The theta synchronization effect was strongest on the Fz electrode. The P300 effect was strongest on the Pz electrode. Our results indicated that theta synchronization is correlated with concealing information and might reflect some changes in related deception.},

abstract={Gender bias within Artificial intelligence driven systems is currently a hot topic and is one of a number of areas where the data used to train, validate and test machine learning algorithms is under more scrutiny than ever before. In this paper we investigate if there is a difference between the nonverbal cues to deception generated by males and females through the use of an automated deception detection system. The system uses hierarchical neural networks to extract 36 channels of non-verbal head and facial behaviors whilst male and female participants are engaged in either a deceptive or truthful roleplaying task. An Image Vector dataset, comprising of 86584 vectors, is collated which uses a fixed sliding window slot of 1 second to record deceptive or truthful slots. Experiments were conducted on three variants of the dataset, all males, all females and mixed in order to examine if the differences in cues generated by males and females lead to differences in the accuracies of machine learning algorithms which classify their behavior. Results showed differences in nonverbal cues between males and females, with both genders at a disadvantage when treated by classifiers trained on both genders rather than classifiers specifically trained for each gender. However, there was no striking disadvantageous effect beyond the influence of their relative frequency of occurrence in the dataset.},

The incidence of “hand(s) in pocket(s)” was found to increase from truth telling to deceiving conditions when the risk of deception detection was higher, and to decrease from truth telling to deceiving conditions when the risk was lower. Higher risk of deception detection was also found in magnifying the “overall negative and controlled impression” displayed by both deceivers and truth tellers, compared to the lower risk of detection condition. We also discussed the possible effects of risk of deception detection and depletion of self-regulation, on deception behavior. Further studies and the connection between this study and the research community of computer vision and multimodel interaction is also discussed.},

abstract={In the recent years, especially during the last decade electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interface (BCI) have become a prevailing study of neuroscience, machine learning and rehabilitation. A BCI provides an arena for a human brain to communicate with a computer directly without the normal neurophysiologic pathways. The electrical signals of the brain, with their fast responsivity with cognitive processes are most suitable as non-motor control mediation between the human and a computer. This can serve as a communication and control channel for various applications. One of the most intriguing uses of EEG is in forensic investigation, used as a tool in lie detection. Lie detection technology has been applied increasingly to investigate and solve criminal cases. Though the contributions of neurobiological research to forensic technology remain largely hypothetical, the evidences appear promising and further research is both feasible and warranted. The brain based lie detection may veritably give solution to many complicated investigation. This paper explores the evolvement of lie detection technology, their working principles, the latest development, and the prospect of their application in forensic science.},

abstract={During a forensic interview, high-stakes deception is very prevalent notwithstanding the heavy consequences that might result. This paper proposes an automated computer vision solution for detecting high-stakes deception based on facial clues. Four deceptive cues (eye-blink, eyebrow motion, wrinkle occurrence and mouth motion) were identified and integrated into a single facial behavior pattern vector for discerning deception and honesty. A Random Forest classifier was trained using an unconstrained video database and applied to classify facial patterns into either deceptive or truthful categories. The labeled database we created was based on open sources such as YouTube. The interview videos used for training and testing the classifier were selected on the basis of high-stakes criminal situations, such as murder or kidnapping, which were later verified by criminal trials. Despite the many uncontrolled factors (illumination, head pose and facial occlusion) in the videos, we have achieved an accuracy of 76.92% when discriminating liars from truth-tellers. This compares well with 80.9% [1], the best extant accurary obtained by experienced interrogators.},

In this study, 4 participants performed mock lying protocol by answering some questions and during that time their hemodynamic responses are acquired from prefrontal cortex by fNIR device. By proper signal processing steps, we have found a single time domain feature (slope of deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) concentration) from some specific channels (channel 1-4 & 9-12) position that differentiates the brain activities between answering lie and truth. The results are justified by statistical hypothesis with 95% confidence interval (p <; 0.05)). This research work will be helpful for designing the embedded system for lie detection.},

abstract={In this paper continuation of previous research done on lie detection using infrared imaging has been presented. Previously it was shown that lie detection using infrared imaging is possible and is actually very accurate (with accuracy of up to 84%). This paper showed a different type of detection algorithm using the implementation of time moving average. All data for this experiment was collected from 11 subjects, which were asked to answer 15 questions in three different times. The first time they were asked to state the truth, the second time they were asked to lie, and finally they were asked to mix their answers and state when they lied and when they said the truth. Then three different post processing methods were used in order to attempt and detect lies. This paper presents the results of detection using the time moving average method. It was first shown that this method has the same characteristics that support the hypothesis, meaning the truth data does not have wide peaks, and the lie data has wide peaks. Then the accuracy of the time domain moving average was found to be 85%, which is greater than current polygraph and previous methods presented. Finally, it was concluded that this method is more efficient and these findings could lead to a new era in the lie detection industry due to this method's efficiency, accuracy, and cost effectiveness.},

abstract={Detecting deception is complicated for humans even though it often happens in human communications. In contrast, machines can capture small features to achieve accurate deception-detection, which is difficult for humans. Classifiers based on supervised learning make it possible to analyze effective features for deception-detection by giving positive and negative samples of deception to the classifier. FastText is one accurate classifier for a variety of classification problems, sentiment analysis, or the tagging of sentences, all of which use the distributed representation of features. We constructed a deception detector for dialogue utterances by giving labels of deception to FastText. We also combined acoustic features for deception-detection and analyzed the deception-detection results. The resultant detector achieved significantly higher accuracy than deception-detection by humans.},

abstract={Face based deception detection systems are non-invasive and are more convenient than other deception detection systems as the facial images can be captured and analyzed without the knowledge of the subject being analysed. Deception detection research studies show that blink rate is an indicator of deception. Some studies concluded that blink rate increases during deception, whereas some other researchers concluded that during deception blink rate decreases. The goal of the current study is to analyse blink count and blink duration of truth and lie responses of various subjects while answering interview questions. In this paper a psychological experiment was conducted for deception detection wherein the blink count and blink duration of the 50 subjects were analysed for truth and lie responses for 10 control questions. The questions are related to name, age, place, house, marital status, entertainment, food and religion. The analysis shows that blink duration and blink count are more while lying.},

abstract={Deception detection has received an increasing amount of attention in recent years, due to the significant growth of digital media, as well as increased ethical and security concerns. Earlier approaches to deception detection were mainly focused on law enforcement applications and relied on polygraph tests, which had proved to falsely accuse the innocent and free the guilty in multiple cases. In this paper, we explore a multimodal deception detection approach that relies on a novel data set of 149 multimodal recordings, and integrates multiple physiological, linguistic, and thermal features. We test the system on different domains, to measure its effectiveness and determine its limitations. We also perform feature analysis using a decision tree model, to gain insights into the features that are most effective in detecting deceit. Our experimental results indicate that our multimodal approach is a promising step toward creating a feasible, non-invasive, and fully automated deception detection system.},

We have discovered the most sensitive areas on the human face to monitor facial temperature changes. Detection algorithms are then developed to identify concealed knowledge from thermal imaging automatically. Face landmark tracking is used directly on the thermal video images to detect regions of interest (ROI) and extract features for concealed knowledge inference. We achieved an equal error rate (EER) of 16.5% in concealed knowledge recognition for 16 subjects on test data. Our non-contact method of concealed knowledge detection using thermal data achieves similar or better recognition accuracy as traditional intrusive methods, such as polygraph or EEG.},

abstract={Recently many researches have focused on the lie detection (LD) using the event-related-potentials (ERPs) of EEG signals. Deception is a complex cognition process which involves activities in different brain regions. However, most of current ERP-based LD systems only focus on extracting the various features from the EEG signals on one or few channels. In this study, we used the phase lag index (PLI) to establish brain network connections and applied graph theory approach to investigate structure features in functional networks. Thirty participants were required to tell the truth or lie when facing certain stimuli, and their EEG signals were recorded. Statistical analysis indicates that the differences in the extracted graph-based features between the two groups were significant. Furthermore, calculated result shows that the guilty group shows more obvious small-world property than the innocent group, which provides a new approach that could automatically identify the deception in future.},

In this paper, a new multimodal dataset is presented, which provides data for deception detection by the aid of various modalities, such as video, audio, EEG and gaze data. The dataset explores the cognitive aspect of deception and combines it with vision. The presented dataset is collected in a realistic scenario and has 35 unique subjects providing 325 annotated data points with an even distribution of truth (163) and lie (162). The benefits provided by incorporating multiple modalities for fusion on the proposed dataset is also investigated. It is our assertion that the availability of this dataset will facilitate the development of better deception detection algorithms which are more relevant to real world scenarios.},

This paper introduces a conceptual model that may aid in detecting deception during high stakes interview style communication, utilizing text analytics tools. The model attempts to examine the interactive nature of communication channels within a real world high stakes case study. More specifically it attempts to show that when the source of interactive communication originated from a richer channel in a field setting deception detection accuracy improves even when examined in a less-rich channel. This paper describes a new model and methodological approach utilizing existing text analytics tools that has the potential to positively impact a wide variety of law enforcement agencies and others who conduct high stakes interviews.},

abstract={Identification of statement is truth or lie is a major problem. It has various applications for safety and clime control. Traditionally physiological activities are monitored during the question-answer round and compare to a normal level. However, because the subject can control his/her physiological reactions, therefore, to overcome these brain signals are used to identify the truth. Brain signal is the first to respond to any sensory impulses which can be used to identify the person is telling the truth or lying. The EEG signals describe the brain signal activity of a person. In this paper, a deep learning method has been used for automatic truth identification from EEG signals by using a convolution neural network. The proposed model has taken 14 channel EEG signals as input to convolution neural network for classification of the signal into the truth or lies statements. The proposed method has achieved up to 84.44% accuracy to identify a person is telling a truth or lie. The proposed method is non-invasive, efficient and robust and has low time complexity making it suitable for realtime applications.},

For laboratory investigation, several mock lying protocols are used those are verbal lying test and that's so why time consuming. In this research, a new method of mock lying protocol is proposed. With the help of this protocol, some subjects performed mock lying protocol (A written lying protocol) and during that time their hemodynamic responses are collected from prefrontal cortex by fNIR device. It is noteworthy that lying by written is more deceivable than verbal test. Therefore, the main challenge is to discriminate the very little change of hemodynamic response with respect to true answering condition. By this method, we have focused some such characteristics of brain function during lying make the proposed method convenient to detect lie. Furthermore, channel wise significant features are presented to differentiate the brain activities between answering lie and truth. In addition, the specific positions of prefrontal cortex with activation intensity (activation range) are identified while participants lie. This method can be applied for lie detection by observing some more studies.},

abstract={With e-commerce transforming the way in which individuals and businesses conduct trades, online reviews have become a great source of information among consumers. With 93% of shoppers relying on online reviews to make their purchasing decisions, the credibility of reviews should be strongly considered. While detecting deceptive text has proven to be a challenge for humans to detect, it has been shown that machines can be better at distinguishing between truthful and deceptive online information by applying pattern analysis on a large amount of data. In this work, we look at the use of several popular pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText) with deep neural network models (CNN, BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM) to determine the influence of word embedding on the accuracy of detecting deception. Some pre-trained word embeddings have shown to adversely affect the classification accuracy when compared to training the model on text embedding using the domain specific data. Through the combination of CNN and BiLSTM along with the fastText pre-trained word embeddings, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 88.8 percent on the hotel review dataset published by Ott et al. in 2011.},

pages={492-506},
abstract={Detecting deception in interpersonal dialog is challenging since deceivers take advantage of the give-and-take of interaction to adapt to any sign of skepticism in an interlocutor's verbal and nonverbal feedback. Human detection accuracy is poor, often with no better than chance performance. In this investigation, we consider whether automated methods can produce better results and if emphasizing the possible disruption in interactional synchrony can signal whether an interactant is truthful or deceptive. We propose a data-driven and unobtrusive framework using visual cues that consists of face tracking, head movement detection, facial expression recognition, and interactional synchrony estimation. Analysis were conducted on 242 video samples from an experiment in which deceivers and truth-tellers interacted with professional interviewers either face-to-face or through computer mediation. Results revealed that the framework is able to automatically track head movements and expressions of both interlocutors to extract normalized meaningful synchrony features and to learn classification models for deception recognition. Further experiments show that these features reliably capture interactional synchrony and efficiently discriminate deception from truth.},

A learned dictionary using K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) is considered for sparse signal representation. The work incorporates parameterization of nonlinear Teagor Energy Operated Critical Band Autocorrelation Envelop (TEO-CB-Auto-Env) feature extraction of speech samples. The database developed by IIT Guwahati with five stress categories includes Angry, Happy, Lombard, Neutral and Sad. The corpus has speech samples in Hindi language and hence the proposed stress classification system is applicable for Indian context. Weka, Neural Network and Autoencoder Neural Network are used for classification. A better recognition accuracy around 5% higher is gained in this work compared with earlier work on speech based stress recognition on the same database. The comparative performance shows that Random Forest classifier from Weka performs better than Neural Network and Autoencoder Neural Network.},

abstract={This paper presents the development and commercialisation of a computerised, non-invasive psychological profiling system (named `Silent Talker'), for the analysis of nonverbal behaviour. Nonverbal signals hold rich information about mental, behavioural and/or physical states the detection of which would be beneficial in a wide variety of commercial domains, particularly deception detection and security. Previous attempts to extract individual signals and classify an overall behaviour have been overly complex, time-consuming, costly, biased and error prone. Silent Talker overcomes these problems by the use of Artificial Neural Networks. The testing and validation of the system was undertaken by detecting processes associated with `deception' and `truth' which the system achieved with significant results. Initial academic recognition led to widespread publicity but the commercialisation of the project proved to be far from straightforward. This paper describes the system itself, its potential uses and the commercialisation process to date, concluding with lessons that have been learnt along the way.},

abstract={Automated deception detection (ADD) from real-life videos is a challenging task. It specifically needs to address two problems: (1) Both face and body contain useful cues regarding whether a subject is deceptive. How to effectively fuse the two is thus key to the effectiveness of an ADD model. (2) Real-life deceptive samples are hard to collect; learning with limited training data thus challenges most deep learning based ADD models. In this work, both problems are addressed. Specifically, for face-body multimodal learning, a novel face-focused cross-stream network (FFCSN) is proposed. It differs significantly from the popular two-stream networks in that: (a) face detection is added into the spatial stream to capture the facial expressions explicitly, and (b) correlation learning is performed across the spatial and temporal streams for joint deep feature learning across both face and body. To address the training data scarcity problem, our FFCSN model is trained with both meta learning and adversarial learning. Extensive experiments show that our FFCSN model achieves state-of-the-art results. Further, the proposed FFCSN model as well as its robust training strategy are shown to be generally applicable to other human-centric video analysis tasks such as emotion recognition from user-generated videos.},

abstract={Authorship profiling which is a process of the extraction of information about the unknown autohr of a text (demographics, psychological traits, et al.) based on the analysis of linguistic parameters, is a problem of great importance. Research in authorship profiling has always been constrainted by the limited availability of training data since collecting textual data with the appropriate metadata (information about authors of texts) requires a lot of effort. We are presenting RusPersonality - first Russian-language corpus of written texts labeled with data on their authors. A unique aspect of our corpus is the breadth of the metadata (gender, age, personality, neuropsychological testing data, education level, ect). Most texts were designed especially for this corpus, do not contain any borrowings and are not edited. The corpus is desinged to serve multiple purposes: authoriship profiling, authorship attribution, deception detection, genre detection etc. The corpus currently contains over 1850 documents from 1145 respondents and is currently expanding. The average length of the texts is 230 words. The corpus can freely be used for academic research purposes on demand. The article describes the structure of the corpus and also shows the results of the research performed at our laboratory using its material and analyzes the perspectices for furture studies.},

Therefore an effective,light weight approach is a must.There are several technologies used in deception detection. EEG based deception detection is one such approach. P300 wave is most commonly used in EEG based deception detection which depends on a stimuli. The study provides an alternative approach to deception detection instead of using P300.Twelve subjects were participated to the study and EEG signals were recorded while they were telling truths and lies. The preprocessed EEG data then fed in to feature extraction and machine learning algorithm alone with Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) paradigm to create a model. Logistic regression classifier was used as the machine learning algorithm to classify the eeg signal. The test data were used on the trained model with cross validation. There were significant difference between truth telling and lying signals. The average rate of correctly predicted the class was 76%.},

abstract={Identity deception has become an increasingly important issue in the social media environment. The case of blocked users initiating new accounts, often called sockpuppetry, is widely known and past efforts, which have attempted to detect such users, have been primarily based on verbal behavior (e.g., using profile data or lexical features in text). Although these methods yield a high detection accuracy rate, they are computationally inefficient for the social media environment, which often involves databases with large volumes of data. To date, little attention has been paid to detecting online deception using nonverbal behavior. We present a detection method based on nonverbal behavior for identity deception, which can be applied to many types of social media. Using Wikipedia as an experimental case, we demonstrate that our proposed method results in high detection accuracy over previous methods proposed while being computationally efficient for the social media environment. We also demonstrate the potential of nonverbal behavior data that exists in social media and how designers and developers can leverage such nonverbal information in detecting deception to safeguard their online communities.},

abstract={Facial behaviour of deception has emerged as an important topic in surveillance research. In this paper, we evaluate the facial behaviour of deception based on some of the cues identified in the literature. First, we present a short review of deception cues in facial behaviour. Then, we run a pilot study, using a rapport style one-to-one interview scenario, under controlled and experimental conditions. Following the standard practice, the experiment has been designed to incorporate three stages. Stage one: facilitation session, in which the baselines are established for each participant. Stage two: interrogation session, in which the participants are required to answer questions on two topics - one truthfully and one falsely. Stage three: self-reporting session, in which the participants are required to report the ground truth for stage two. Once the data regarding visible images of facial behaviour was collected, it was analysed and compared to the facial behaviour cues identified in literature. For statistical analysis, a non-parametric sign-test was selected. The results indicated that there is potential in applying facial behaviour as the cues in predicting deception. Finally, a discussion on future work introduce more subtle facial actions analysis is presented.},

Earlier work revealed that `Sharing of Reliable and complete information' plays a significant role in implementing concurrent engineering. It is essential to have a framework and methods which enable deception detection in product development that provides an indication on the reliability of the information.

abstract={We present work on deception detection, where, given a spoken claim, we aim to predict its factuality. While previous work in the speech community has relied on recordings from staged setups where people were asked to tell the truth or to lie and their statements were recorded, here we use real-world political debates. Thanks to the efforts of fact-checking organizations, it is possible to obtain annotations for statements in the context of a political discourse as true, half-true, or false. Starting with such data from the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab, which was limited to text, we performed alignment to the corresponding videos, thus producing a multimodal dataset. We further developed a multimodal deep-learning architecture for the task of deception detection, which yielded sizable improvements over the state of the art for the CLEF-2018 Lab task 2. Our experiments show that the use of the acoustic signal consistently helped to improve the performance compared to using textual and metadata features only, based on several different evaluation measures. We release the new dataset to the research community, hoping to help advance the overall field of multimodal deception detection.},

The proposed adaptive denoising approach, extracts three kinds of features from denoised wave to reproduce P300 waveform and identify the P300 components at the Pz electrode.

abstract={It has long been hypothesized that the ability to deceive depends on personality - some personality types are `better' at deceiving in that their deception is harder to recognize. In this work, we evaluate how the pattern of personality of a speaker affects the effectiveness of machine learning models for deception detection in transcripts of oral speech. We trained models to classify as deceptive or not deceptive statements issued in Court by Italian speakers. We then used a system for automatic personality recognition to generate hypotheses about the personality of these speakers, and we clustered the subjects on the basis of their personality traits. It turned out that deception detection models perform differently depending on the patterns of personality traits which characterize the speakers. This suggests that speakers who show certain types of personality also have a communication style in which deception can be detected more, or less, easily.},

abstract={Extensive evidence suggests the feasibility of lie detection using electroencephalograms (EEGs). However, it is largely unknown whether there are any differences in the nonlinear features of EEGs between guilty and innocent subjects. In this study, we proposed a complexity-based method to distinguish lying from truth telling. A total of 35 participants were randomly divided into two groups, and their EEG signals were recorded with 14 electrodes. Averages for sequential sets of five trials were first calculated for the probe responses within each subject. Next, a common wavelet entropy (WE) measure and an improved one were used to quantify complexity from each five-trial average. The results show that for both measures, the WE values in the guilty subjects are statistically lower than those in the innocent subjects for most of the 14 electrodes. More importantly, using the improved measure, the difference in WE between the two groups of subjects significantly increases for 11 brain regions compared with the values from the common measure. Finally, the highest balanced classification accuracy, 89.64%, is achieved when using the combined WE feature vector in five brain regions from the sites of Pz, P3, C4, Cz, and C3. Our findings indicate that the lying task elicits a more ordered brain activity in some specific brain regions than the task of telling the truth. This study not only demonstrates that improved WE measurements could be a powerful quantitative index for detecting lying but also sheds light on the brain mechanisms underlying deceptive behaviors.},

abstract={Polygraph has been widely used to detect lie which measures some physiological parameters in human body but many researchers believe that lie can be detected more precisely if we can find the neuronal changes which occur during a deception process. To investigate the hemodynamic response related to deception, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the subject. Commercially available polygraph system, Paragon acquisition system (PAS) is used to measure the physiological parameters like respiration and electrodermal activity (EDA) during the deception process. A mock crime scenario with a stimulus of single trial is used as a deception protocol. The acquired data is classified into true and lie classes, based on hemoglobin concentration changes in case of fNIRS and based on the physiological signal changes for polygraph data. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used as a classifier. In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of different temporal windows in classification of combined fNIRS-polygraph signals for lie detection. The results show that the best time window for fNIRS-polygraph system is 2-7 s and 0-7 s for fNIRS and polygraph data respectively.},

First, eleven different subjects were chosen to participate in this project. Then, using a FLIR ThermoVision A40 infrared camera the data was collected from eleven different subjects in three different sets of measurement. This paper presents the results using two different methods of detection. The first method of detection was using a time domain analysis and the second method of detection was using a frequency domain analysis. Each of these methods had an accuracy of 69% and 84% in detecting lies, respectively. Finally, the two methods were compared to current polygraph, which has an accuracy of 83%. It was concluded that it is possible to detect lies using an infrared camera and that it is actually better than current polygraph since it has higher accuracy, is non invasive, and cost effective.},

abstract={There exist many forms of deception detection techniques such as Polygraph, Graphology but they are invasive and expert dependent system which can be sometimes easily thwarted by criminals. This project aims to utilize a physiological factor that is involuntary during lying to measure the response credibility of a suspect. One such factor is eye blink count and some studies proposed that blink rate increases during deception, whereas some studies proposed that during deception blink rate decreases. The objective of the current study is to analyze blink count by developing a computer vision application that is capable of detecting and counting eye blinks in video streams using facial landmarks to determine the credibility of response of various suspects while answering the interrogative questions. In this paper an experiment was conducted where 16 subjects were grouped into two and were asked to perform a mock crime and Interrogated where questions were based on the Concealed Information Test. The analysis shows that during critical questions directly related to crime scene, the suspect tends to have higher blink rate than normal whereas innocents tend to have lowered blink rate than under normal situation. This system is expected to be used in places such as Visa Interviews, Interrogations on Airports, petty criminal and civil case investigations in courts etc., where the credibility of the statements provided by the suspects is of great importance.},

year={2013},
volume={56},
number={3},
pages={210-225},
abstract={Research problem: Due to globalization and the increased availability of online collaboration tools, individuals are now likely to work together in settings where computers are their primary mode of communication. However, because communication characteristics are different in virtual team settings, especially when they are text based, communication problems, such as deception, arise. Recent research found that deceptive individuals in virtual teams can have a negative impact on group task performance, and it recognized that in addition to the communication medium, task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, are important influences in these settings. However, the impacts of these additional influences have not been empirically examined. Research question: Does group members' experience with each other and task complexity affect their deception detection accuracy and task performance in a computer-mediated communication setting? Literature review: Previous literature has shown that deceivers are an important influence on computer-mediated groups. However, few studies have compared different group settings, and no studies have empirically tested the impact that task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, have on these types of groups. Methodology: An experiment was designed to test the effect of group member experience and task complexity on computer-mediated groups facing deception. Two-hundred fifty-six undergraduates (256) were selected for the experiment. Results and conclusions: Quantitative analysis, which included multivariate analysis of variance, revealed that (a) groups performing a low-complexity task were better at detecting deception than were groups performing a high-complexity task, (b) groups with members who had experience with each other had higher task performance than did inexperienced groups, and (c) experienced groups did not have higher accuracy in detecting deception than did inexperienced groups. These results highlight the importance of understanding the different affects that task complexity and group member experience have on virtual teams facing deception, and they provide insight into what practices can help minimize the impact of interactive computer-mediated deception.},

abstract={Most psychologists argue that facial behavioral during lying is different from facial behavioral when telling the truth, so the facial behavioral can be used as reliable indicators for spotting liars. The deception detection systems (DDSs) based on facial expressions are non-invasive, mobile and cost-effective. In this work a DDS is dependent on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for facial features extraction, the main idea of FACS is to describe all facial actions using Action Units (AUs), each AU is related to movement one or more facial muscles. Eight AUs are used which incorporated into a single facial behavior pattern vector; these AUs are AUs 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 23, and 28. Datasets are collected for 43 subjects (20males, 23 females) most of them between ages 18-25. Four types of classification algorithms are used individually in the last stage of the proposed system; these classifiers are MLP, KNN, VG-RAM, and SVM. The simulation results show that the best results are obtaining when using VG-RAM and KNN classifiers. The main contributions of this work are new classification techniques in DDS, collect real database that can use to measure the performance of any DDS based on facial expressions, and select suitable facial features.},

abstract={Deception is considered a ubiquitous social phenomenon that has a significant implications in clinical, moral, and law enforcement domains. In this study, we propose a novel electroencephalography (EEG)-based approach for detecting deception. The proposed approach utilizes higher-order spectra (HOS) analysis, namely the bispectrum analysis, to construct a representation of the EEG signals. The constructed bispectrum-based representation is utilized to compute a set of features that can be used to identify deception in EEG signals. Specifically, the extracted features are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify EEG signals into guilty or innocent classes. The performance of the proposed EEG-based deception detection approach was evaluated using EEG signals that were recorded for eleven subjects who participated in a guilty knowledge test (GKT). The results reported in the current study demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed in detecting deception using EEG signals. In particular, the average classification accuracy obtained in differentiating between the innocent and guilty classes is equal to 74%.},

abstract={Over the past decade Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been helping hundreds of millions of people develop reliable computer-mediated relations. However, many user profiles in OSNs contain misleading, inconsistent or false information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user's privacy. In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for information posted on OSNs to be trusted. Here we define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders in Twitter. In addition, we report empirical results with our stratified data set consisting of 174,600 Twitter profiles with a 50-50 breakdown between male and female users. Our automated approach compares gender indicators obtained from different profile characteristics including first name, user name, and layout colors. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator and the strength of all possible values for each indicator through extensive experimentations with our data set. We define male trending users and female trending users based on two factors, namely the overall accuracy of each characteristic and the relative strength of the value of each characteristic for a given user. We apply a Bayesian classifier to the weighted average of characteristics for each user. We flag for possible deception profiles that we classify as male or female in contrast with a self-declared gender that we obtain independently of Twitter profiles. Finally, we use manual inspections on a subset of profiles that we identify as potentially deceptive in order to verify the correctness of our predictions.},

abstract={Considering the current landscape of the internet where there is a plethora of social networking sites and collaborative websites like Wikipedia concern about malicious users keeping multiple accounts is of prime importance. Most of the collaborative sites allow users to easily create an account and start accessing the content. Social media services such as collaborative project's single user constantly creates many accounts with different account names not long after a block has been applied. The blocked person who creates multiple accounts is called sockpuppet. Current mechanism for detecting deception are based on human deception detection (e.g., speech or text). Although these method have high detection accuracy, but it cannot be applied in databases with large volumes of data. So they are computationally inefficient. There is an efficient method for detecting identity deception by using both Nonverbal (e.g., user activity or Movement) and Verbal Behavior (facial expression, text) in the social media environment. These methods increase high detection accuracy. Post examination and close monitoring on these methods which finds out that it can be applied to any social media environment.},

abstract={Micro-expressions are the hidden human emotions that are short lived and are very hard to detect them in real time conversations. Micro-expressions recognition has proven to be an important behavior source for lie detection during crime interrogation. SMIC and CASME II are the two widely used, spontaneous micro-expressions datasets which are available publicly with baseline results that uses LBP-TOP for feature extraction. Estimation of correct parameters is the key factor for feature extraction using LBP-TOP, which results in long computation time. In this paper, the video sequences are interpolated using temporal interpolation(TIM) and then the facial features are extracted using deep convolutional neural network(DCNN) on CUDA enabled General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit(GPGPU) system. Results show that the proposed combination of DCNN and TIM can achieve better performance than the results published in baseline publications. The feature extraction time is reduced due to the usage of GPU enabled systems.},

abstract={Facial expression recognition plays an important role in lie detection, and computer-aided diagnosis. Many deep learning facial expression feature extraction methods have a great improvement in recognition accuracy and robutness than traditional feature extraction methods. However, most of current deep learning methods need special parameter tuning and ad hoc fine-tuning tricks. This paper proposes a novel feature extraction model called Locally Linear Embedding Network (LLENet) for facial expression recognition. The proposed LLENet first reconstructs image sets for the cropped images. Unlike previous deep convolutional neural networks that initialized convolutional kernels randomly, we learn multi-stage kernels from reconstructed image sets directly in a supervised way. Also, we create an improved LLE to select kernels, from which we can obtain the most representative feature maps. Furthermore, to better measure the contribution of these kernels, a new distance based on kernel Euclidean is proposed. After the procedure of multi-scale feature analysis, feature representations are finally sent into a linear classifier. Experimental results on facial expression datasets (CK+) show that the proposed model can capture most representative features and thus improves previous results.},

And sparse coefficients are obtained by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Then we use those coefficients as features to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and test the classifier accuracy based on the trained model. Finally, we present the experimental results of this approach and compare the results with the conventional features consisting of Short-Time, Pitch, Formant, and Duration based on corpus of Soochow University Speech Processing Researches-Deception Speech Detection Corpus (SUSP-DSD).

abstract={Deception is the act of lying. This is common to criminology cases where authorities use lie detection methods to detect deception. Existing lie detection methods are not used as sufficient evidence due to its subjectivity and low accuracy. As years passed by, there has been a perpetual search for a technology-based objective method and development in methods of lie detection which includes the use of the EEG. The researchers aim to contribute to this developing method by characterizing and comparing the brain wave signals of two distinct IQ levels during deception. Emotiv EPOC+ is the equipment that used to acquired brain signals. Students aged 18 to 22 were chosen as study volunteers for this research. This research conducted two trials where in the volunteers were asked if a particular Pokémon card displayed on the monitor is their card in possession. The equipment is placed on the volunteer's head while he/she was being asked. The first round is the truth stage and the second round is the denial stage. The data gathered underwent pre-processing stages such as data extraction, windowing, and feature extraction where the processed data is fed into an ANOVA Statistical analysis test.},

abstract={High-stakes lying causes detectable changes in human behavior and physiology. Lie detection techniques based on behavior analysis are unobtrusive, but often require laborintensive efforts. Lie detection techniques based on physiological measurements are more amenable to automated analysis and perhaps more objective, but their often obtrusive nature makes them less suitable for realistic studies. In this paper we present a novel lie detection framework. At the core of this framework is a physiological measurement method that quantifies stress-induced facial perspiration via thermal imagery. The method uses a wavelet-based signal processing algorithm to construct a feature vector of dominant perinasal perspiration frequencies. Then, pattern recognition algorithms classify the subjects into deceptive or truthful by comparing the extracted features between the hard and easy questioning segments of an interview procedure. We tested the framework on thermal clips of 40 subjects who underwent interview for a mock crime. We used 25 subjects to train the classifiers and 15 subjects for testing. The method achieved 80% success rate in blind predictions. This framework can be generalized across experimental designs, as the classifiers do not depend on the number or order of interview questions.},

abstract={Brain signals were started to use in deception detection process from last few years. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can reveal many important features of our thought which make it as a better tool for deception detection. A number of experiments were done in terms of visual stimuli based EEG signals. The purpose of this paper is to improvise the existing methods in the classification of familiar and unfamiliar faces which can be used as a basic model in deception detection. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based classification of EEG signals for the given visual stimuli. In this experiment, the subjects were shown by familiar and unfamiliar faces. After processing using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the signal was fed to an autoencoder for classification. By training the model properly we got a mean accuracy of 82.21% which is far better than the models using conventional machine learning methods. Our model achieved the state of the art results for classification of familiar and unfamiliar EEG signals.},

abstract={Lie detection is a necessary skill for a variety of social professions, including teachers, reporters, therapists, and law enforcement officers. Autonomous system and robots should acquire such skill to support professionals in numerous working contexts. Inspired by literature on human-human interaction, this work investigates whether the behavioral cues associated to lying - including eye movements and response temporal features - are apparent also during human-humanoid interaction and can be leveraged by the robot to detect deception. The results highlight strong similarities in the lying behavior toward humans and the robot. Further, the study proposes an implementation of a machine learning algorithm that can detect lies with an accuracy of 75%, when trained with a dataset collected during human-human and human robot interaction. Consequently, this work proposes a technological solution for humanoid interviewers that can be trained with knowledge about lie detection and reuse it to counteract deception.},

By summarizing the characteristics of the current technology, this paper proposes a multi-channel concealed polygraph technology based on ballistocardiogram (BCG), which can make up for the shortcomings of the existing technology. In this paper, the BCG signal, image signal, speech signal and galvanic skin response (GSR) signal are used to preprocess and extract the features. Using the extracted features to train the classification model, we can get an overall accuracy of 78%, and the area under the curve (AUC) score is 0.84.

abstract={Most efforts at improving deception detection involve either the examination of a suspect's behavioral and physiological cues or are aimed at improving the ability of an interviewer to distinguish between truth and deception. The research presented here employs a dyadic approach to deception detection. This is a relatively novel method which utilizes the complex interplay and mutual influence between the deceiver and the receiver by examining the relationship between interactional synchrony and deception. This field experiment uses criminal interviews of both guilty (deceptive) and innocent (truthful) suspects to explore the impact of deception on different measures of vocalic and linguistic synchrony. Preliminary results indicate that deceivers may strategically synchronize to the interviewer in an attempt to allay suspicion.},

pages={645-650},
abstract={Recent research in deception detection has focused on the use of Avatars, where an animated computer-generated talking head (an embodied agent) interviews a subject by asking a series of questions. The Avatar then records the ensuing verbal responses in an audio file for further analysis. The use of an Avatar can potentially mitigate issues related to biases (e.g., cultural, economical, personality related etc.) encountered when a human agent interviews a subject. In this work, we extend the capabilities of an existing Avatar system, by designing a method to capture the physiological state of the subject via Electrodermal Activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), and thermal imaging sensors during the course of the interview. The goal of this exercise is to synchronize the recorded audio responses to the Avatars generated questions with physiological measurements (e.g., facial thermal imaging recording) of the subject thereby facilitating a broader range of analysis leading to effective deception detection and human identification measurements. For example, thermal-based face images can be used to verify the identity of an interviewee.},

The most important advantage to be leveraged when using this database is the casework nature of the content, i.e. all the speakers were suspects or witnesses in real criminal investigations, and all interactions are spontaneous and are part of actual law enforcement activity. Around 5 hours of recorded material have been extracted from archives and processed. With a total number of 19 speakers (4 female, 15 male), 39% of the content is objectively annotated as untruthful, in a global sense. Using a standard framing scheme (25 ms frames with 15 ms overlap), the 1,225,464 available segments would create a large and reliable dataset.},

In this paper, we construct a video corpus for developing a system that detects lies in conversations. The corpus consists of 540 question-answer pairs by 9 persons; 270 true answers and 270 lies.

abstract={Facial expression recognition has been widely used to solve the problems such as lie detection and human-machine interaction. However, due to the difficulties to control the application environments, current methods have the lower recognition accuracy in practice. This paper proposes a new method for facial expression recognition by considering several aspects. First, human beings are easy to recognize some expressions, while difficult to recognize others. Inspired by this intuition, a new loss function is proposed to enlarge the distances between samples from easily confused categories. Second, human learning is divided into many stages, and the learning objective of each stage is different. Thus, dynamic objectives learning is proposed, where each objective at different stage is defined by the corresponding loss function. In order to better realize the above ideas, a new deep neural network for facial expression recognition is proposed, which integrates the covariance pooling layer and residual network units into the deep convolution neural network so as to better perform dynamic objectives learning. The experimental results on the standard databases verify the effectiveness and the superior performance of our methods.},

abstract={Facial micro-expressions are subtle and involuntary expressions that can reveal concealed emotions. Micro-expressions are an invaluable source of information in application domains such as lie detection, mental health, sentiment analysis and more. One of the biggest challenges in this field of research is the small amount of available spontaneous micro-expression data. However, spontaneous data collection is burdened by time-consuming and expensive annotation. Hence, methods are needed which can reduce the amount of data that annotators have to review. This paper presents a novel micro-expression spotting method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on optical flow features. We extract Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF) features to encode the temporal changes in selected face regions. Finally, the RNN spots short intervals which are likely to contain occurrences of relevant facial micro-movements. The proposed method is evaluated on the SAMM database. Any chance of subject bias is eliminated by training the RNN using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. Comparing the spotted intervals with the labeled data shows that the method produced 1569 false positives while obtaining a recall of 0.4654. The initial results show that the proposed method would reduce the video length by a factor of 3.5, while still retaining almost half of the relevant micro-movements. Lastly, as the model gets more data, it becomes better at detecting intervals, which the proposed method suitable for supporting the annotation process.},

Through this method, promising results of 25-30% improvement in recognition performance are achieved. By further magnifying the decomposed emotion components, the subtle emotions intensity can be increased and further boost recognition performance by 3-4%.},

abstract={Forensic electroencephalogram (EEG)-based lie detection has recently begun using the concealed information test (CIT) as a potentially more robust alternative to the classical comparative questions test. The main problem with using CIT is that it requires an objective and fast decision algorithm under the constraint of limited available information. In this study, we developed a simple and feasible hierarchical knowledge base construction and test method for efficient concealed information detection based on objective EEG measures. We describe how a hierarchical feature space was formed and which level of the feature space was sufficient to accurately predict concealed information from the raw EEG signal in a short time. A total of 11 subjects went through an autobiographical paradigm test. A high accuracy of 95.23% in recognizing concealed information with a single EEG electrode within about 20 seconds demonstrates effectiveness of the method.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider transcripts which originated from a practical series of Turing's Imitation Game that was held on June 23, 2012, at Bletchley Park, U.K. In some cases, the tests involved a three-participant simultaneous comparison of two hidden entities, whereas others were the result of a direct two-participant interaction. Each of the transcripts considered here resulted in a human interrogator being fooled, by a machine, into concluding that they had been conversing with a human. Particular features of the conversation are highlighted, successful ploys on the part of each machine are discussed, and likely reasons for the interrogator being fooled are considered. Subsequent feedback from the interrogators involved is also included.},

abstract={With the increasing reliance on social media as a dominant communication medium for current news and personal communications, communicators are capable of executing deception with relative ease. While past-related research has investigated written deception in traditional forms of computer mediated communication (e.g. email), we are interested determining if those same indicators hold in social media-like communication and if new, social-media specific linguistic cues to deception exist. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) we present results on human subjects experimentation to confirm existing and new linguistic cues to deception; 2) we present results on classifying deception from training machine learning classifiers using our best features to achieve an average 90% accuracy in cross fold validation.},

abstract={Previous attempts at supply chain risk management are often non-technical and rely heavily on policies/procedures to provide security assurances. This is particularity worrisome as there are vast volumes of data that must be analyzed and data continues to grow at unprecedented rates. In order to mitigate these issues and minimize the amount of manual inspection required, we propose the development of mathematically-based automated screening methods that can be incorporated into supply chain risk management. In particular, we look at methods for identifying deception and deceptive practices that may be present in the supply chain. We examine two classes of constraints faced by deceivers, cognitive/computational limitations and strategic tradeoffs, which can be used to developed graph-based metrics to represent entity behavior. By using these metrics with novel machine learning algorithms, we can robustly detect deceptive behavior and identify potential supply chain issues.},

abstract={Spreading of fake news is a social phenomenon that is pervasive at the social level between individuals, and also through social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Fake news that we are interested in is one of many kinds of deception in social media, but it's more important one as it is created with dishonest intention to mislead people. We are concerned about this issue because we have noticed that this phenomenon has recently caused through the means of social communication to change the course of society and peoples and also their views, for example, during revolutions in some Arab countries have emerged some false news that led to the absence of truth and stirs up public opinion and also fake of news is one of the factors Trump successes in the presidential election. So we decided to face and reduce this phenomenon, which is still the main factor to choose most of our decisions. Techniques of fake news detection varied, ingenious, and often exciting. In this paper our objective is to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake or not based only its content, thereby approaching the problem from a purely deep learning perspective by RNN technique models (vanilla, GRU) and LSTMs. We will show the difference and analysis of results by applying them to the dataset that we used called LAIR. We found that the results are close, but the GRU is the best of our results that reached (0.217) followed by LSTM (0.2166) and finally comes vanilla (0.215). Due to these results, we will seek to increase accuracy by applying a hybrid model between the GRU and CNN techniques on the same data set.},

abstract={The attempt to spot deception through its correlates in human behavior has a long history. Until recently, these efforts have concentrated on identifying individual "cues" that might occur with deception. However, with the advent of computational means to analyze language and other human behavior, we now have the ability to determine whether there are consistent clusters of differences in behavior that might be associated with a false statement as opposed to a true one. While its focus is on verbal behavior, this book describes a range of behaviors—physiological, gestural as well as verbal—that have been proposed as indicators of deception. An overview of the primary psychological and cognitive theories that have been offered as explanations of deceptive behaviors gives context for the description of specific behaviors. The book also addresses the differences between data collected in a laboratory and "real-world" data with respect to the emotional and cognitive state of the liar. It discusses sources of real-world data and problematic issues in its collection and identifies the primary areas in which applied studies based on real-world data are critical, including police, security, border crossing, customs, and asylum interviews; congressional hearings; financial reporting; legal depositions; human resource evaluation; predatory communications that include Internet scams, identity theft, and fraud; and false product reviews. Having established the background, this book concentrates on computational analyses of deceptive verbal behavior that have enabled the field of deception studies to move from individual cues to overall differences in behavior. The computational work is organized around the features used for classification from 𝑛-gram through syntax to predicate-argument and rhetorical structure. The book concludes with a set of open questions that the computational work has generated.},

abstract={When a child is suspected to be the victim or sole witness of a crime, the manner in which information is gathered from the child becomes critical. A child forensic interview is the guided conversation that a legal expert conducts to elicit reliable information from a child. To help substantiate child testimony, it is important to discern characteristics of truthful and deceptive behavior in these interviews. The work presented uses various machine learning algorithms to identify differences in the speech of children when they are lying or being truthful, particularly when they have been asked by a confederate to deceive an interviewer. Results show that vocabulary and psycho-linguistic norms of a child's language use, in response to directed questions, provide substantial information to outperform human adults in detecting truthful statements.},

abstract={Social networks in general and Twitter, in particular, have become criminal-friendly tools used to contact and deceive their preys and also, for making covert advertising of their illicit activities. In this paper, we collect and process tweets to detect deception related to sex trafficking using predefined criteria as input features to machine learning classifiers. According to the applicable legal law existing in most of our countries, any minor, who is used to participate in a commercial sex act is a trafficking victim. For this reason, in this work, we used the identification of the possible age of the likely victims as one of the essential criteria for the detection of tweets related to human trafficking for sexual exploitation. We tested the validity of predefined features used for the classification of suspected tweets against the rating made by experts. With reasonable precision, we detected tweets possibly related to sex trafficking of underage girls, information that might guide to the police towards antisocial Twitter users and may be useful for law enforcement in the fight against this detestable crime. We used a semi-supervised learning technique with Naîve Bayes and SVM algorithms to classify the tweets as "suspicious" or "not - suspicious" of being related to sex trafficking.},

abstract={The creators of fake news often use facts from verified news sources and layer them with misinformation to confuse the reader, either intentionally or unintentionally. It can be increasingly seen as a threat to democracy, public order and free debate that can cause confusion and provoke unrest. Several websites have taken on the mission of fact-checking rumors and claims – particularly those that get thousands of views and likes before being debunked and dismissed by expert sources. To prevent fake news from being spread among online users, a near real-time reaction is crucial. Fact-checking websites are often not fast enough to verify the content of all the news being spread. Fake news detection is a challenging task aiming to reduce human time and effort to check the truthfulness of news. In this paper, we propose an approach that is able to identify possible fake news spreaders on social media as a first step towards preventing fake news from being propagated among online users. Therefore, we conduct different learning experiments from a multilingual perspective, English and Spanish. We evaluate different textual features that are primarily not tied to a specific language and compare different machine learning algorithms. Our results indicate that language-independent features can be used to distinguish between possible fake news spreaders and users who share credible information with an average detection accuracy of 78% for the English and 87% for the Spanish corpus.},

abstract={In object recognition a robust feature set is considered as an important component in almost all the approaches proposed in the literature. In facial analysis, one of the best known feature set is based in Local Binary Patterns (LBP) which extracts the information contained in the image using comparisons between pixels in a region, finally such comparisons are encoded in form of histogram. We argue that this kind of encoding is statistically non-stable and can lead to errors during the recognition process, specially in noisy and low-resolution images, where the information contained in the image is not enough to generate a statistically robust histogram. In this paper, we propose a new method to encode the Local Binary Patterns using an re-parametrization of the second local order Gaussian Jet which generates more robust and reliable histograms suitable for different facial analysis tasks. We show that our method can be used for recognizing micro-expressions with competitive performances on the Spontaneous Micro-expression Corpus (SMIC) and the YORK Deception Detection Test.},

abstract={Effective and real-time eyeblink detection is of wide-range applications, such as deception detection, drive fatigue detection, face anti-spoofing. Despite previous efforts, most of existing focus on addressing the eyeblink detection problem under constrained indoor conditions with relative consistent subject and environment setup. Nevertheless, towards practical applications, eyeblink detection in the wild is highly preferred, and of greater challenges. In this paper, we shed the light to this research topic. A labelled eyeblink in the wild dataset (i.e., HUST-LEBW) of 673 eyeblink video samples (i.e., 381 positives, and 292 negatives) is first established. These samples are captured from the unconstrained movies, with the dramatic variation on face attribute, head pose, illumination condition, imaging configuration, etc. Then, we formulate eyeblink detection task as a binary spatial-temporal pattern recognition problem. After locating and tracking human eyes using SeetaFace engine and KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) tracker respectively, a modified LSTM model able to capture the multi-scale temporal information is proposed to verify eyeblink. A feature extraction approach that reveals the appearance and motion characteristics simultaneously is also proposed. The experiments on HUST-LEBW reveal the superiority and efficiency of our approach. The comparisons with the existing state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our manner for eyeblink detection in the wild.},

The state of an individual's face is a revealing indicator that may be used for soft biometrics, active authentication, deception detection, response feedback, and other areas of interface. One related psychological indicator is the Duchenne smile that usually indicates a genuine, spontaneous, or enjoyed emotional state rather than a forced or posed state, as likely expressed by a non-Duchenne smile. Differentiating between these is a useful task to automate for a variety of reasons. This paper discusses a classification technique that achieves higher recognition rates than previously published for similar comparisons.},

abstract={Recently computational methods for deception detection at e-markets have attracted a lot of researchers' attention since various deceptive means are threating customers' participation at e-markets. However, relatively little research is conducted regarding the detection of fraudulent transactions at e-markets, such as Taobao, the largest C2C and B2C e-market in China. One of the main contributions of this paper is the illustration of a novel fraudulent transaction detection model developed based on the deceptive clues induced from transactional information archived at Taobao. More specifically the proposed detection model is underpinned by the probability distribution of a transaction being fraudulent. Accordingly, based on this estimated probability distribution of fraudulent transactions, an enhanced reputation mechanism is proposed to alleviate the effect of sellers' inflated reputations via fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, according to the rating rules on Taobao, an instantiation of the proposed reputation mechanism is made to apply it to a realistic e-market environment. The long-term implication of our research is that the marketers or managers of e-markets can design a fairer trading and reputation mechanism for their shopping websites. Our proposed fraudulent transaction detection and reputation mechanism will contain the trend of creating fraudulent transactions at e-markets.},

abstract={Knowledge-based systems (KBS) can potentially enhance individual decision making. Yet, recommendations from these systems continue to be met with resistance. This is particularly troubling in professions associated with deception detection (e.g., border control), where humans are accurate only about half the time. In this research-in-progress, we examine how the fit between KBS explanations and users' internal explanations influences acceptance of system recommendations. To describe the explanations, we rely on Toulmin's argument classifications. We leverage cognitive fit theory as the theoretical explanation as to why fit is important for user acceptance of the system's evaluation.

abstract={Deception is a very common phenomenon and its detection can be beneficial to our daily lives. Compared with other deception cues, micro-expression has shown great potential as a promising cue for deception detection. The spotting and recognition of micro-expression from long videos may significantly aid both law enforcement officers and researchers. However, database that contains both micro-expression and macro-expression in long videos is still not publicly available. To facilitate development in this field, we present a new database, Chinese Academy of Sciences Macro-Expressions and Micro-Expressions (CAS(ME)2), which provides both macro-expressions and micro-expressions in two parts (A and B). Part A contains 87 long videos that contain spontaneous macro-expressions and micro-expressions. Part B includes 300 cropped spontaneous macro-expression samples and 57 micro-expression samples. The emotion labels are based on a combination of action units (AUs), self-reported emotion for every facial movement, and the emotion types of emotion-evoking videos. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) was employed for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions and the results were reported as a baseline evaluation. The CAS(ME)2 database offers both long videos and cropped expression samples, which may aid researchers in developing efficient algorithms for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions.},

abstract={The aim of our study is to examine whether the overall organization of behavior differs when people report truthful vs. deceptive messages within the framework of the T-pattern model. We tested the hypothesis that the differences between liars and truth tellers will be greater under high cognitive load conditions. We argue that recalling stories in reverse order will produce cognitive overloading in subjects, because their cognitive resources are already partially spent on the lying task; this should emphasize nonverbal differences between liars and truth tellers. Results support the hypothesis that discriminating behavioral patterns between truth and lie could be easier under high cognitive load condition. Moreover, they suggest that future research on deception detection may focus more on patterns of behavior rather than on individual cues.},

pages={5628-5634},
abstract={Generalized communicative suspicion (GCS) has been implicated in the deception literature as a trait that causes individuals to believe they can accurately detect deception in face-to-face settings. Separately, the online deception literature has implicated users' heuristic processing as the reason for them failing to recognize deception and falling prey to cybercrimes like phishing attacks. Such online deception work, however, has yet to explore how GCS might affect individual abilities to detect deception in a mediated context. The current work connects these two streams of research by introducing information insufficiency as a mediator between GCS and processing and extending it to the phishing context. We find that high GCS increases uncertainty and leads to a desire for more information before making a judgment. Desiring more information leads to systematically processing available information and more accurate phishing deception detection.},

Based on the automatic deception detection system (ADDS) developed in the iBorderCtrl project, issues such as the peculiarities of the interaction of humans with machines, profiling, automated decision-making and the risk of false positives can be identified and demonstrate how computational intelligence based systems can challenge fundamental legal and ethical principles. These include in particular the right to privacy, human dignity and the principle of non-discrimination. By further analysing the various issues, this paper seeks to provide some thoughts on remedies and safeguards which should be considered when developing computational intelligence based systems.},

year={2019},
volume={7},
number={},
pages={59237-59248},
abstract={The high-precision geolocation of Internet hosts plays an important role in many applications, such as online advertising and deception detection. The existing typical high-precision geolocation algorithms usually utilize single-hop or relative delay to geolocate an Internet host at street-level granularity. However, it is difficult to accurately measure the single-hop or relative delay within a city. This challenge sometimes results in large geolocation errors. To solve this problem, a street-level geolocation algorithm based on router multilevel partitioning is proposed. Unlike existing typical algorithms, the proposed algorithm makes a credible hypothesis that each router has a relatively stable service object for a period of time. By analyzing the connection between routers and landmarks, the possible geographic service ranges of routers are inferred from the geographic distribution of landmarks. Then, distance constraints arising from routers' service ranges are formed to estimate the geographic location of the target IP. Theoretical analysis of the geolocation error shows that the maximum and average errors of the proposed algorithm are less than those of existing typical algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by geolocating a total of 12,152 target IP addresses located in four cities in different regions. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing typical street-level geolocation algorithms SLG and NC-Geo, the average median error of the proposed algorithm decreases from 4.735 km and 3.776 km to 3.25 km, representing error reductions of approximately 31.36% and 13.96%, respectively.},

abstract={Micro-expressions are facial expressions which are fleeting and reveal genuine emotions that people try to conceal. These are important clues for detecting lies and dangerous behaviors and therefore have potential applications in various fields such as the clinical field and national security. However, recognition through the naked eye is very difficult. Therefore, researchers in the field of computer vision have tried to develop micro-expression detection and recognition algorithms but lack spontaneous micro-expression databases. In this study, we attempted to create a database of spontaneous micro-expressions which were elicited from neutralized faces. Based on previous psychological studies, we designed an effective procedure in lab situations to elicit spontaneous micro-expressions and analyzed the video data with care to offer valid and reliable codings. From 1500 elicited facial movements filmed under 60fps, 195 micro-expressions were selected. These samples were coded so that the first, peak and last frames were tagged. Action units (AUs) were marked to give an objective and accurate description of the facial movements. Emotions were labeled based on psychological studies and participants' self-report to enhance the validity.},

abstract={Detecting lies or deceptive statements in text is a valuable skill. This is partly because the patterns that underlie deceptive text are not known. The aim of this work is to identify patterns that characterize deceptive text. A key step in this approach is to train a classifier based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) network. BERT beats the state of the art in deception classification accuracy on the Ott Deceptive Opinion Spam corpus. The results of our ablation study indicate that certain components of the input, such as some parts of speech, are more informative to the classifier than others. Further part-of-speech analysis in "swing" sentences that are considered important to BERT's classification indicates that deceptive text is more formulaic and less varied than truthful text. We expanded our classifier into a new Generative Adversarial Network based on BERT to create exemplars of deceptive and truthful text that further showed the differences between truth and deception, reinforcing the underlying similarity of deceptive text in terms of part-of-speech makeup.},

For analyzing real life natural stress, the voice of crime suspects was recorded during ongoing interrogations at the police station. PRAAT software was used for analysis. Results indicated a significant increase in the mean fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequencies F1, F2. Marginal decrease in jitter was observed, however, shimmer did not at all correlate to stress due to deception.

We also developed a deception card game scenario that entices human participants to lie either to a robot or a human game partner, allowing us to monitor and understand the correlations between human physiological manifestations and their trustworthiness. Our results show the existence of statistically significant correlations between the participants' deceptive behaviour and their heart rate, skin conductance, face position, and face orientation.

abstract={Fake smile is an emotional sign on the face that can be used as information for non-verbal communication. One of its functions is for lie detection purpose based on the information of emotional sign generated on the face. The emergence of fake smile indicates that there are negative emotions, uncomfortable feeling, and something hidden in a person. This research aims to detect fake smile. In fact, real smile is characterized by the contraction of zygomatic major muscle on the edge of mouth corner and obicularis oculli muscle on the eyelids. However, on a fake smile, zygomatic major muscle experiences contraction, but obicularis oculli muscle doesn't contract. Contraction of the zygomatic major muscle is identified by the appearance of wrinkles on the cheeks corner of the mouth, whereas obicularis oculli contraction is identified by the feature value of eye elongation. On the test image, segmentation of RoI (Region of Interest) is done on cheeks and eyes. On the RoI (Region of Interest) cheeks, wrinkle density is calculated; whereas elongation value is calculated on the RoI (Region of Interest) eyes. Based on the two variables above, with support vector machine linear for its classification, smile is classified into two classes, i.e. real smile and fake smile. The test result showed that the accuracy of system is 86 %, whereas the error rate is 14%.},

It is known that efficient feature extraction is the key to a good classification accuracy in BCI systems. EEG discriminative features between familiar and unfamiliar names of people, presented in text format as visual stimuli, have not been reported in literature. Detection of familiar and unfamiliar names can play a distinct role in psychology, clinical assessment of cognitive impairment, lie detection, investigations and interrogations. In this paper, the subject's familiarity to names of people was studied based on EEG signals obtained while the subjects were exposed to familiar and unfamiliar names as a visual stimulus in the form of text. The discriminative features were found to be subject-specific. Using three subject-specific features, an average classification accuracy of 84.37% for familiar vs. unfamiliar names was achieved among 8 subjects.},

abstract={Three key cognitive components involved in deception, i.e., working memory, inhibition control and task switching share a most fundamental neuropsychological process, i.e., execution control. Although dissociable neuroanatomies associated with individual cognitive component for deception have been identified by fMRI, practical application of fMRI in lie detection remains constrained by its limited accessibility and low affordability, compared with which, EEG has greater advantages. However, fewer theoretical studies have been reported from EEG community and hence leads to the lack of EEG based knowledge on deception. This study therefore aims to propose new methods to extend the current EEG researches in deception by carrying out EEG source localization method combined with connectivity analysis on EEG data collected from fifteen subjects, who participated in a deception paradigm inducing both instructed lying (IL) and instructed truth-telling (IT) conditions. The results show that: (1) significant ERS in upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) in cuneus is observed for IL compared with IT condition, (2) event related connectivity strength between neural substrates responsible for execution control in executing selectively retrieving, monitoring and scrutinizing memory information is observed increased in upper alpha band for IL compared with IT condition, (3) regional and global clustering coefficient derived in connectivity analysis have shown strong correlation to the response time, and (4) relative higher upper alpha band power founded during self-reflection period may indicate sustained alertness.},

abstract={Recently, micro-expression recognition has attracted lots of researchers' attention due to its potential value in many practical applications, e.g., lie detection. In this paper, we investigate an interesting and challenging problem in micro-expression recognition, i.e., cross-database micro-expression recognition, in which the training and testing samples come from different micro-expression databases. Under this problem setting, the consistent feature distribution between the training and testing samples originally existing in conventional micro-expression recognition would be seriously broken, and hence, the performance of most current well-performing micro-expression recognition methods may sharply drop. In order to overcome it, we propose a simple yet effective framework called domain regeneration (DR) in this paper. The DR framework aims at learning a domain regenerator to regenerate the micro-expression samples from source and target databases, respectively, such that they can abide by the same or similar feature distributions. Thus, we are able to use the classifier learned based on the labeled source micro-expression samples to predict the label information of the unlabeled target micro-expression samples. To evaluate the proposed DR framework, we conduct extensive cross-database micro-expression recognition experiments designed based on the Spontaneous Micro-Expression Database and Chinese Academy of Sciences Micro-Expression II Database. Experimental results show that compared with the recent state-of-the-art cross-database emotion recognition methods, the proposed DR framework has more promising performance.},

abstract={Fake or incorrect or miss-information detection has nowadays attracted attention to the researchers and developers because of the huge information overloaded in the web. This problem can be considered as equivalent to lie detection, truthfulness identification or stance detection. In our particular work, we focus on deciding whether the title of a news is consistent with its body text- a problem equivalent to fake information identification. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning approach where the problem of detecting title-body consistency is posed from the viewpoint of Textual Entailment (TE) where the title is considered as a hypothesis and news body is treated as a premise. The idea is to decide whether the body infers the title or not. Evaluation on the existing benchmark datasets, namely Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset (released in Fake News Challenge Stage 1 (FNC-I): Stance Detection) show the efficacy of our proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art systems.},

title={Recognizing Facial Expressions Using a Shallow Convolutional Neural Network},
year={2019},
volume={7},

pages={78000-78011},
abstract={Generally, facial expressions could be classified into two categories: static facial expressions and micro-expressions. There are many promising applications of facial expression recognition, such as pain detection, lie detection, and babysitting. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods suffer from two critical problems when they are adopted to recognize micro-expressions. First, they are usually dependent on very deep architectures that overfit on small datasets. However, reliable expressions are relatively difficult to collect and relevant datasets are usually relatively small. Second, for micro-expressions, these methods usually neglect the temporal redundancy of micro-expressions which could be utilized to reduce the temporal complexity. In this paper, we propose a shallow CNN (SHCNN) architecture with only three layers to classify static expressions and micro-expressions simultaneously without big training datasets. To better explain the functionality of our SHCNN architecture, we improve the saliency maps by introducing a shrinkage factor after studying the vanishing gradient problem of existing saliency maps. Experiments are conducted on five open datasets: FER2013, FERPlus, CASME, CASME II, and SAMM. To the best of our knowledge, by comparing with other methods offering source code (or pseudo code), we believe that our method would be the best on FERPlus, CASME, and CASME II and competitive on FER2013 and SAMM.},

abstract={With the increasing rate of crime, deceit identification has become an issue of concern. The main task here is to classify the EEG data recorded for lie detection, into innocent and guilty. Although various methods have been developed in past to classify EEG data, deep belief nets are rarely used. This paper uses a deep learning technique using the restricted Boltzmann machine with wavelet to obtain the time and frequency domain information of signals. A deep belief network is developed with four RBMs stacked together. Softmax regression is utilized at output layer to classify EEG data into guilty and innocent. An experiment has been performed on EEG data recorded by performing a “Concealed Information Test”. The test consists of a mock crime scenario where some relevant and irrelevant images are presented in front of subjects. The EEG signals generated after flashing these images are recorded and analyzed.},

pages={263-268},
abstract={Emotion recognition through facial expression analysis is an emerging research in Artificial Intelligence which faces many challenges. The problem is the variation of facial expressions that displays human emotions. Humans can subjectively express the same emotions in various ways. To overcome the problem of ambiguity in emotion expression, a fuzzy approach is developed to analyze the facial components in determining the type of emotion. In this study, we proposed a framework for fuzzy emotion recognition as a representation of the psychologist knowledge. Three stages in the fuzzy emotion recognition were facial feature extraction with Active Appearance Model; Semantic-linguistic facial features extraction; fuzzy emotion recognition with Fuzzy Emotion Classification. System performance testing provided the best results on extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) facial expression dataset, with the accuracy of linguistic facial component recognition 0.98, and accuracy of fuzzy emotion recognition 0.90. Testing was also performed on custom-made Indonesian Mixed Emotion Dataset (IMED) which resulted in accuracy of 0.87. The fuzzy emotion recognition has a potential to be applied in various real problems such as virtual counseling, stress detection, lie detection, and e-commerce.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an improved hybrid technique for spontaneous micro-expression based human emotion recognition. Micro-expressions are the involuntary gestures that people often try to conceal and suppress. But these expressions can be important tools for potential humanitarian applications such as lie detection, enhancing relationships, national security, clinical therapy and psychiatry. An effective micro-expression recognition technique requires feature extraction and classification. We select and extract features in the first phase using optimal Firefly algorithm. The second phase follows improved swarm optimized functional link artificial neural network (ISO-FLANN) algorithm for feature classification. Finally, emotion recognition is done taking weighted outputs of the classified features. To implement the proposed system, CASME II database of micro-expression collection has been used. Performance of the proposed system is evaluated presenting important figures of merit. We report an overall recognition rate of 68.65% which is superior to the state of the art methods. The proposed method is a simulation based study of human micro-expressions and thus adds useful contribution to the field of human computer interaction.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Despite a revolution in the pervasiveness of video cameras in our daily lives, one of the most meaningful forms of nonverbal affective communication, interpersonal eye gaze, i.e. eye gaze relative to a conversation partner, is not available from common video. We introduce the Interpersonal-Calibrating Eye-gaze Encoder (ICE), which automatically extracts interpersonal gaze from video recordings without specialized hardware and without prior knowledge of participant locations. Leveraging the intuition that individuals spend a large portion of a conversation looking at each other enables the ICE dynamic clustering algorithm to extract interpersonal gaze. We validate ICE in both video chat using an objective metric with an infrared gaze tracker (F1=0.846, N=8), as well as in face-to-face communication with expert-rated evaluations of eye contact (r= 0.37, N-170). We then use ICE to analyze behavior in two different, yet important affective communication domains: interrogation-based deception detection, and communication skill assessment in speed dating. We find that honest witnesses break interpersonal gaze contact and look down more often than deceptive witnesses when answering questions (p=0.004, d=0.79). In predicting expert communication skill ratings in speed dating videos, we demonstrate that interpersonal gaze alone has more predictive power than facial expressions.},

abstract={Online news platforms greatly influence our society and culture in both positive and negative ways. As online media becomes more dependent for source of information, a lot of fake news is posted online, that widespread with people following it without any prior or complete information of event authenticity. Such misinformation has the potential to manipulate public opinions. The exponential growth of fake news propagation have become a great threat to public for news trustworthiness. It has become a compelling issue for which discovering, examining and dealing with fake news has increased in demand. However, with the limited availability of literature on the issue of uncovering fake news, a number of potential methodologies and techniques remains unexplored. The primary aim of this paper is to review existing methodologies, to propose and implement a method for automated deception detection. The proposed methodology uses deep learning in discourse-level structure analysis to formulate the structure that differentiates fake and real news. The baseline model achieved 74% accuracy.},

Such kind of examples can't be seen to the symptomatic significance of a special case, as extraordinary inquiry till it has been joined honestly.

A technique to perceive cluster of bizarre data join indicate atypical territory of a little subset of features. This strategy uses an invalid model to for ordinary topic and after that distinctive test to distinguish all clusters of bizarre examples.},

abstract={On-line questionnaires are today widely used for various tasks, from census data collection to knowledge testing in job interviews. However, there is currently no automated system that can help us decide if the answers from the questionnaires are reliable or estimate how reliable the are. Deception is a part of everyday human behavior and deception is also present when answering on-line questionnaires. People are trying to make themselves look better or are just withholding information for malicious reasons. In our paper we present a method for automatic prediction of honesty for answers in a questionnaire. We demonstrate that by using new technologies like eye-tracking, we can create an automated system which can help us estimate reliability and truthfulness of the answers from on-line questionnaires. In our paper we have proposed and evaluated several metrics that can be used for automated detection of user deception in on-line questionnaires and we have also created and tested our first automated system for deception detection, based on these metrics.},

year={2012},
volume={55},
number={4},
pages={345-362},
abstract={Research problem: Phishing is an email-based scam where a perpetrator camouflages emails to appear as a legitimate request for personal and sensitive information. Research question: How do individuals process a phishing email, and determine whether to respond to it? Specifically, this study examines how users' attention to “visual triggers” and “phishing deception indicators” influence their decision-making processes and consequently their decisions. Literature review: This paper draws upon the theory of deception and the literature on mediated cognition and learning, including the critical role of attention and elaboration in deception detection. From this literature, we developed a research model to suggest that overall cognitive effort expended in email processing decreases with attention to visual triggers and phishing deception indicators. The likelihood to respond to phishing emails increases with attention to visceral cues, but decreases with attention to phishing deception indicators and cognitive effort. Knowledge of email-based scams increases attention to phishing deception indicators, and directly decreases response likelihood. It also moderates the impact of attention to visceral triggers and that of phishing deception indicators on likelihood to respond. Methodology: Using a real phishing email as a stimulus, a survey of 321 members of a public university community in the Northeast US, who were intended victims of a spear phishing attack that took place, was conducted. The survey used validated measures developed in prior literature for the most part and tested results using the partial least-squares regression. Results and discussion: Our research model and hypotheses were supported by the data except that we did not find that cognitive effort significantly affects response likelihood. The implication of the study is that attention to visceral triggers, attention to phishing deception indicators, and phishing knowledge play critical roles in phishing detection. The limitations of the study were that the data were drawn from students, and the study explored one phishing attack, relied on some single-item measures, cognitive effort measure, and a one-round survey. Future research would examine the impact of a varying degree of urgency and a varying level of phishing deception indicators, and actual victims of phishing attacks.},

year={2012},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Some Web Service Discovery and Composition (WSDC) approaches have been used to distinguish similar Web services by combining a collection of services using functionality of the service. Existing approaches for solving the WSDC problem focus mainly on the functional QoS properties of the service rather than the consumer satisfaction and trust aspects. However, different consumers regularly hold differing views of the service contents. Accordingly, the present study proposed a trust-based selection model for QoS-aware service selection referring to Shaikh et al.'s WSDC model considering both the direct rating and the collaborative rating in social trust networks. It appropriately reveals the customer satisfaction of a group on service compositions. The trust score aggregating both QoE (Quality of Experience) and QoC (Quality of Compliance) is introduced to discriminate the priority of service composition based on D-S evidence theory. Finally, an example of QOS-aware web services selection is illustrated to demonstrate the proposed approach. The proposed model effectively solves the trust transition problem in the collaborative rating of the service selection and also enables deception detection in terms of existing evidences that excludes the fraud reports of unreliable agents.},

year={2020},

number={2},
pages={78-88},
abstract={Owing to the continual growth of multimodal data (or feature spaces), we have seen a rising interest in multimedia applications (e.g., object classification and searching) over these heterogeneous data. However, the accuracy of classification and searching tasks is highly dependent on the distance estimation between data samples, and simple Euclidean (EU) distance has been proven to be inadequate. Previous research has focused on learning a robust distance metric to quantify the relationships among data samples. In this context, existing distance metric learning (DML) algorithms mainly leverage on label information in the target domain for model training and may fail when the label information is scarce. As an improvement, transfer metric learning (TML) approaches are proposed to leverage information from other related domains. However, current TML algorithms assume that different domains explore the same representation; thus, they are not applicable in heterogeneous settings where the data representations of different domains vary. In this research, we propose xTML, a novel unified heterogeneous transfer metric learning framework, to improve the distance estimation of the domains of interest (i.e., the target domains in classification and searching tasks) when limited label information, complementary with extensive unlabeled data, is provisioned for model training. We further illustrate how our proposed framework can be applied to a selected list of multimedia applications, including opinion mining, deception detection and online product searching.},
