    "#### 1. Research goals\n",
    "The goal of this literature review is to capture a panoramic view of the state of research on **Deception Detection supported by Machine Learning**, in order to be able to understand trends, results and gaps on the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Research question\n",
    "What are the best performing Machine Learning techniques applied on **automatic Deception Detection**, what features they consume and what level of performance have they recently achieved??\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Research restrictions\n",
    "1. Period of interest is 2011-2020;\n",
    "2. Only non-invasive methods and techniques will be reviewed; by non-invasive, we mean methods that absolutely do not touch the subject nor submit him/her to be evaluated by an equipment less mobile then a regular computer;\n",
    "3. Only studies that report some kind of performance level achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research protocol\n",
    "1. Run queries on selected scientific document bases:\n",

    "3. Import all BibTeX files into BiblioAlly; those documents are tagged as \"IMPORTED\" or \"DUPLICATE\"\n",
    "4. Manually detect duplications not detected during import and tag them as \"DUPLICATE\"\n",

    "### Data extraction\n",
    "After reading the full text of selected papers, each were summarized in two forms:\n",
    "1. **Mind map**: a graphical summarized form of the study;\n",
    "2. **Python dictionary**: an encoded version of the extracted meta-data of interest that can be further computed to produce statistics, charts and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details on each one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mind maps\n",
    "Mind maps are FreeMind documents, manually produced, since BiblioAlly still can't do it automatically (for now we can dream about it, right?). Those mind maps\n",
    "were built to serve as a quick and short summary of the entire article and helped during reading and reviewing their full text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those maps describe the study hypothesis, the contributions, the dataset, the feature modalities, the methods used, and the performance achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meta-data encoding\n",
    "Each article was structured as follows:\n",
    "1. `document_id`: the document id in the BiblioAlly database;\n",
    "2. `methods`: list of methods and tools used in the paper, each item is described as `classifier` or `support`:\n",
    "    1. `classifier`: describes the classification algorithm as:\n",
    "        1. `kind`: when appliable, describes some kind or sub-category of the method;\n",
    "        2. `implementation`: package used as algorithm implementor;\n",
    "        3. `training`: training method used;\n",
    "        4. `performance`: performance achieved by the classifier described as:\n",
    "            1. `kind`: the performance measure used;\n",
    "            2. `value`: the performance level achieved;\n",
    "    2. `support`: describes supporting tools used for some generic purpose;\n",
    "3. `dataset`: description of the dataset used in the study:\n",
    "    1. `public`: True indicates a freely accessible dataset, False the opposite;\n",
    "    2. `mock`: True indicates a dataset collected from some fabricated setting, False means data collected from real-life events;\n",
    "    3. `name`: name of the dataset;\n",
    "    4. `size`: number of rows listed in the dataset;\n",
    "    5. `origin`: source of the data;\n",
    "    6. `target`: labels used in the target attribute;\n",
    "    7. `features`: list of feature kinds in the dataset:\n",
    "        1. `kind`: the kind of detection cue features;\n",
    "        2. `dimensions`: the number of features;\n",
    "        3. `components`: list of feature components;\n",
    "        4. `language`: list of languages, when appliable;\n",
    "        5. `tool`: list of tools, when appliable;\n",
